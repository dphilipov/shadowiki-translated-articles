'''Feuerschwinge''' was a female, [[Great Dragon|Great Dragon]] of orange-red color, who awoke in 2012 in the Harz Mountains in the old [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. He was - presumably - the mate of the Great Dragon [[Kaltenstein]].

==Fate==
After the [[dragon]] Feuerschwinge destroyed parts of the Harz in 2012 - immediately after its appearance - it was pursued by [[Bundeswehr]] task forces across the English Channel, and eventually shot down over the [[SOX]].
{{shadowtalk|As I know from one of the Bundis who was there at the time, it crashed right into the ruins of [[Völklingen]]...|'''''[[Eismann]]'''''|68%}}
In this case, an early [[nanoweapon]] developed by German engineer Dr. [[Adrian Vauclair]] at [[Diehl Defense]] based on the [[warfare agent]]s "[[Doom]]" was used in a special warhead he designed.

However, since no body has been found, the fate of the dragon is unknown, but it is ''officially'' presumed dead, making it the first great dragon killed by [[humans]] since the dawn of the [[Sixth World|Sixth World]].
{{Shadowtalk|Firewing is not dead! SHE is alive and hiding in the SOX, I heard! - However, due to all the poisons there, HER mind has also gone bye-bye, so that SHE is completely insane and also totally mutated. Some voices in the shadows also claim that the punks who live in the SOX worship Firewing!|'''''[[Panic!]]'''''|68%}}
Kaltenstein attacked Luftwaffe planes over the English Channel in defense of Firewing, and later engaged in a dogfight with his fellow [[Nebelherr]] over [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], as the latter tried to prevent him from flying into SOX to search for Firewing. In this, Kaltenstein was defeated only because the weaker Nebelherr received support from [[Lofwyr]] received support.

===Rumors===
Claims that Firewing is possibly alive, and in human form as "[[Ignifera]]" the leader of the [[Glowpunk]] sect "[[Disciples of the Purifying Fire]]" and that she - in dragon form - {{Shx|2058}} intervened in a battle with the [[MET2000]] in the ruins of [[Völklingen]] are usually dismissed as implausible as well, as are their alleged sightings in Iceland {{Shx|2015}}. - Another common theory is that her spirit was separated from her body when she was shot down, but survived, and - at least temporarily - took possession of a metahuman body. Since then, Firewing's spirit has been trying to regain a dragon body. Some also associate Firewing's name (and spirit) with the machinations of the [[AI]] [[Apex]] in anarchist [[Berlin]] of the 2050s and an alleged conspiracy aimed at a dracozide - an extermination of dragons.

==hoard==
In fact, the reason for her rampage after her [[awakening]] was probably not - or not exclusively - "hibernation trauma" and shock upon awakening, which is what the [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Great Dragon]] [[Rhonabwy]] blamed his rampage in [[Carmarthen]], but the rage over the [[theft]] of a certain [[artifact]] that had been stolen by [[human]]s from their [[dragon's lair|hoard]] during their long sleep. This stolen object was - possibly - the "Ring of the Nibelungs" in a unique casket created by a master smith, and at the same time a gift from her beloved companion Kaltenstein.

Treasure hunters trace Feuerschwinge's hoard to this day in the Harz mountains in vain. Other interested parties, however, believe that it is actually located on [[Iceland]] ... the present-day "[[Thule Protectorate]]" under the rule of the [[NAN]] member [[Trans-Polar Aleut Nation]]. The question of which of the two theories is now true is eagerly discussed in the forums of the [[Matrix Portal]]s "[[DIVE]]".
