'''Toxic shamans'''' - often called '''Toxic Shamans''' or simply '''Toxics'''' - are corrupted, twisted [[shaman]]s and also [[sorcerer]]s as well as followers of other, nature magic [[Magical Traditions|Traditions]].

Their magic and magical practice is referred to as '''toxic magic''' or '''poison magic'''. In recent times, it is also more common to speak of a '''Toxic Tradition''' to avoid the ''shaman'' term, as many shamans in particular strive to dismiss any proximity of Toxicists to their own tradition as much as possible.  

==Genesis of the Toxic==

So far, it is assumed by leading [[magic theory|theorists]] that the increasing destruction and contamination of nature has led to the emergence of some [[totem]]s and [[idol]]s their exact inversion into the opposite - malicious and vengeful figures, representing all negative counterparts to their previously known mirror image. Especially nature magicians such as shamans including followers of local traditions such as the [[Korean]]n [[Mudang]] or [[Nordic tradition|Nordic]] [[Gode]]s, Celtic [[Druid]]s, and followers of [[Wicca]] who have been in prolonged contact with the corrupted [[mana]] of a domain that has become toxic, are in turn affected by it in the long run and often ultimately perverted into warped toxicists. Their deeds can range from simple pestering of their fellow humans to the wanton aggravation of already existing ecological disasters and the contamination of previously relatively clean areas to catastrophic world destruction conspiracies of the caliber of [[Winternight]].

However, severe trauma, shock, or other severe negative emotional causes have also been known to cause the mage to turn away from the positive alignment of their totem or idol in order to act out a negative aspect.
It could be a massive outburst of hatred or anger directed at a [[corporation|group]] that is polluting the environment. It could also be despair and grief when one's [[magic]] was not enough to save someone.

For example, a shaman who follows the [[bear (totem)|bear]] totem could go from [[sanologist|healer]] to berserker.

In addition, there are a number of [[Toxic Patrons|Toxic Patrons]], [[Totem]]s, or [[Idol]]s that the Toxicist may turn to in place of their original [[Patron]].

==Categories==
Toxic [[wizard]]s are generally divided into four different categories:

;<span id="Poisoner">Poisoner</span> : The Poisoner is the most common manifestation. He sees the pollution and contamination of the earth as the key to power. Poisoners have been the cause of several environmental disasters in the recent past. They are especially hunted and loathed by [[ecoterrorist]]s and Deep Green activists.
:Their [[Toxic Spirits|Toxic Spirits]] (see below) manifest as embodiments of pollutants and pathogens (e.g., radiation; toxic waste; cancer, disease).

;<span id="Butchers">Butchers</span> : Unlike the Poisoners, Butchers are not dedicated to the destruction of the environment, but to the destruction of humanity. They want to erase mankind from the face of the earth. Thus, Mother Earth has been given the opportunity to heal itself without the influence of humans. They are often bitter '''avengers''', who in the fight for an originally ''good cause'' have at some point lost even the last spark of compassion and any measure. - Toxic shamans in [[Green War]] and other radical [[eco-terrorists]] belonging to the deep-green spectrum are usually ''avengers''/''butchers''.
:Their Toxic Spirits (see below) embody forces of destruction (e.g., Apocalyptic Horsemen, Angels of Death, Pestilence).

;<span id="Devastators">Devastators</span> : Devastators desire the destruction of civilization and society. This is to give [[metahumanity]] the opportunity for a new beginning.
:Their Toxic Spirits (see below) reflect the darker sides of the soul (e.g. addiction, depravity, perversion).

;<span id="Sterilists">Sterilists</span> : Sterilists are the rarest toxic manifestation. They want the eradication of all emotion and strive for order and logic, as would be expected of machines. Although they seem to fit perfectly into the machinery of [[megacorporations]], they are just as dangerous as the other Toxics, and their apparent rationality taken to an extreme instills massive discomfort in even the coldest and most emotionless [[Hermetic]]er. - Toxic [[Mudang]]s who make their living as factory managers in [[Pyongyang]], the former [[North Korea|North Korean]] [[Mudang]]s who, as factory managers in [[Pyongyang]], the former [[North Korean]] capital, use magical mind and motion control to force their workers to literally work themselves to death, are usually sterilists.
:They summon spirits that reflect this distorted order and emotionlessness (e.g., faceless, androgynous entities, machine-like apparitions).

;Mutators : Mutators are the youngest branch of toxic mages and shamans. They were first noticed - consciously - in the wild [[Chicago]] in the 2070s. Their goal is to accelerate and direct evolution with a mixture of perverted magic and no less perverted science to create living beings that have every advantage on their side in the daily struggle for survival and adaptation to a poisoned environment and distorted astral space. They espouse the ideology of "Super Darwinism" and willingly enter into alliances with [[insect shamans]]s for their goal of producing new, superior species and mutations of [[metahumans]] and [[critters]]s (or were themselves before they became toxic), and are also very fond of using [[MMVV infected]]s as test subjects in their unnatural experiments and interventions in natural (and magical) evolution.
:Their preferred toxic spirits are usually [[abomination]]s - i.e. toxic [[spirits of the beast]].

It ultimately does not matter what magical tradition they originally came from, as they have turned away from its ways and toward the '''Toxic Path'''.

== Meaning ==
Toxic shamans are extremely dangerous specifically within poisoned, ravaged environments - a toxic domain - that is similarly diseased and warped as themselves, as they draw additional power from the corrupted [[mana]] and [[background radiation]] there, while all other [[magically gifted]]s are hindered in casting their [[spells]] as a result. [[Spirits]] - Who can become toxic under the same circumstances as [[metahuman|(meta)human]] [[mage]] - in a toxic domain, can practically only be summoned or controlled by toxicists who are equally corrupted, and even these obey [[Toxic Spirits]] only to a certain degree.... Effectively, a Toxic Spirit will fulfill any command that does not correspond to its warped, destructive nature reluctantly, poorly, and sloppily at best, while it will fulfill a Toxic Shaman's orders of murder, devastation, and extensive destruction with all the greatest zeal, only to turn on its [[Summoner]] as soon as the latter shows weakness!

Furthermore, the path of [[initiation]] is also open to Toxic Shamans, allowing them to learn unique toxic [[metamagic|metamagic skills]] with which they can harm their surroundings and fellow humans even more effectively!

Because of their sociopathic attitudes and behavior patterns, and their twisted, often downright insane state of mind, most Toxic Shamans are extreme loners, virtually unable to work with others (including other Toxics) as part of a team. In the rare cases where Toxics do effectively form [[magical groups]], as is the case with Winternight or even the [[Glow Punks|Glow Punk cults]] of the [[SOX]], the danger each poses on his own is multiplied many times over....

For all the foregoing reasons, Toxic Shamans and other Toxics pose a significant [[magical threat]], and are common in the magical community of the [[Sixth World|Sixth World]] - but also in virtually all other social circles - as hated as, say, [[blood mages]] or [[insect shamans]], and are actively opposed by many mages and shamans.

'''Toxic Shamans''' (or just '''Toxics''') are corrupted, twisted [[shaman]]s, [[Mage|magicians]]  and followers of other, nature magic [[Magical Traditions|Traditions]].

Their magic and magical practice is referred to as '''toxic magic''' or '''poison magic'''. In recent times, it is also more common to speak of a '''Toxic Tradition''', as many shamans strive to dismiss any proximity of Toxic Shamans to their own tradition.


'''Toxic shamans''' are regarded as followers of their [[mentor spirit]]s, just like their non-toxic counterparts. However, due to external influences like excessive pollution, or the mentality and will of their shaman, the influence a mentor spirit exerts can differ drastically from a typical shaman. A Dog shaman, for example, typically displays characteristics of loyalty and protectiveness towards those it associates with (its "pack", so to speak). A toxic Dog shaman, on the other hand, might act instead as vicious and treacherous, forgoing its associates to follow an agenda all his/her own.

This doesn't mean that the shaman is acting in opposition with its mentor spirit, but rather has adopted the mentor spirit's darker aspect. In the above example, the toxic Dog shaman is still acting characteristic of a dog, but now more akin to if the Dog spirit were rabid.
==Genesis of the Toxic==
It is assumed by leading [[magic theory|theorists]] that the increasing destruction and contamination of nature has led to the emergence of some [[totem]]s and [[idol]]s that are the oppisite of their true nature - malicious and vengeful figures, representing all negative counterparts to their original image. Nature magicians, such as shamans, followers of local traditions such as the [[Korean]] [[Mudang]] or [[Nordic tradition|Nordic]] [[Gode]]s, Celtic [[Druid]]s, and followers of [[Wicca]] who have been in prolonged contact with the corrupted [[mana]] of a domain that has become toxic, are affected and often perverted into warped Toxics. Their deeds can range from simple pestering of their fellow humans, to the aggravation of already existing ecological disasters and the contamination of previously clean areas and even to catastrophic world destruction conspiracies such as [[Winternight]].
