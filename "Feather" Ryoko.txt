"'''Feather'''' '''Ryoko''''' is - despite her nickname - [[Japan|half-Japanese]] and a [[Gilette]], a female [[Knife Claw]].

==Biography==
[[File:Feather Ryoku (SW).JPG|thumb|left|"Feather" Ryoko (older image) {{Ref|1}} {{C Pegasus}}<br/><small>(<u>Artist:</u> [[Andreas "AAS" Schroth]])</small>]
After serving a few years in [[Big Willi]] for a failed action against [[Ares Macrotechnology]], she was freshly released in the early {{Shx|2070s}}. She had taken a bodyguard job with the [[Vory]] dealer [[Dag "Stomp" Joergensen]], which she sees as a stepping stone back into the [[Shadow]] business, even though she had no love for the [[Lobatchevski]]s, the [[Ork]] or [[BTL Chips]]. - Her loyalty to the [[Russia|Russians]] was accordingly not overly high, even if like any Runner she has a reputation to uphold, and is quite capable in the bodyguard business. - She usually responds to threats and interrogation attempts with accentuated boredom.... {{Ref|1}} {{Ref|2}}

However, the (ex-)[[Shadowrunner]] had quite a bit of stress with her parole officer, who got her a legal job at a [[Matrix]] café as a parolee, and exploited her to the best of her ability along with her boss there, pocketing half her pay for the day job. - She also lacked [[Connections]], and would have been happy if someone could hook her up with a good new [[Slider]] {{Ref|1}} {{Ref|2}}

When the Russians' business in [[Bergedorf]] came under pressure, and went increasingly bad, "Feather" Ryoko then took her fate into her own hands: she rammed her wakizashi into her ''client'' "Stomp" Joergensen, and took over what was left of his business activities. Meanwhile - in 2080 - she joined forces with the "[[Kreeper]]"-[[Gang]], which has its turf in Anekistraße in Neuallermöhle, and is thick in the [[cram]] business {{Ref|3}}.

She is also said to have been seen more recently in the "[[Mikado]]" in [[Hamburg-Nord]] {{Ref|3}}.

==Appearance==
Feather is of medium height, well-toned, and can be attractive if she puts in the effort. She is slender and dark haired. Most of the time, she wears the usual [[synthetic leather outfit]]s along with [[armored vest]]s in monochromatic gray and black with an inconspicuous red appliqué on the collar and slightly contrasting colored protectors in the upper arm area on the sleeves of the jacket. - Her ballistic-lined undergarment (see image at left), however, is decidedly less dressy.... {{Ref|1}} {{Ref|2}}.

==Equipment==
Besides the obligatory [[commlink]] and a [[knife]], she is also armed with an [[Ares Predator]] and an [[Ingram Smartgun]] when she's out with Stomp, or squatting in his pad in Bergedorf, which alone would be enough to get her back to Big Willi if the [[HanSec]] caught her with it {{Ref|1}} {{Ref|2}}

===Bodyware===
Before she was even in prison, she also implanted herself with some [[cyberware]], which includes both [[smartgun wiring]] and [[reflex boosters]] that make her movements seem almost unnaturally smooth and powerful, and also possesses an implant that makes her tolerate pain significantly better than an [[uncybertarian]]s [[human]]s {{Ref|1}} {{Ref|2}}

==Relationships==
Because she flat out refuses to join the "[[Willis]]" and join the gang of ex-Big Willi inmates, she is hated by them. The Vory probably doesn't have much kind things to say about her or to her either {{Ref|3}} because of the murder of "Stomp", whom she was supposed to protect.

[[Likedeeler]] and possibly the [[Yakuza]], on the other hand, seem interested in establishing a business relationship with her {{Ref|3}}

On their own current enemies list, the gang of "[[Creatures]]" is at the top, as these psycho-punks are direct competitors of their "Kreepers" in the cram-biz in Bergedorf {{Ref|3}}.
