{{Shadowtalk|Hej everyone!

Been reading along here on your node for a few days now, so courtesy dictates that I introduce myself.<br>.
My current name is Niall Mackay. My real one isn't, but [[Scotland]] is true, although I've only recently spent two weeks in [[Aberdeen]] My parents had to emigrate before I was born because some damn ecos made sure their hometown was now nice and oily black. <br>
I made my first shadow contacts under a different name in the new world, but a little misunderstanding with the [[Triads]] made me decide to pay a longer visit to the continent of my ancestors after all. (But I'd do it again - too bad I didn't get to keep the tank).
Well, now I'm here - mainly I'm active in the [[Öresund-Plex]], but [[Hamburg]] and especially the coasts of the southern [[Baltic Sea]] I've already got to know. <br>

What do I offer: <br>
- Driving (rigged and unrigged) of [[vehicles]]s of all kinds (ground, water and underwater), [[drones]], substitute hacking and a passable handling of shot and [[pistol]]s <br>
- Well-equipped workshop in [[Malmö]]<br>
- Contacts in every notable city in the Southern Baltic Region (Good, that's not that many either.)<br>
- Smuggling to [[Pomorya]] and out<br>
- 5% discount if going against ecos, 10% against [[GreenWar]] (more for destruction and [[Wetwork]])<br>

That's it, I think. <br>

{{Shadowtalk|Oho, Nial - then you're like a direct competitor for me, the crew, and my good old "[[Impaler of Irongrad]]": [[smuggling]] by sea, between Hamburg, [[NDB]], to the SkandU, the [[Baltic States]] and Pomorya? - But okay, the market and North Sea and Baltic Sea are big enough to feed one (or more) more independent smugglers as well...<br>

I personally don't think much about wetwork, but - if I take the personal background you described here as a basis - I can understand your hatred for the green guerrillas and the hardcore eco-terrorists GreenWars very well... I don't want to have anything to do with them myself, and with the [[Klabauterbund]] I had quite some stress because of their militant anti-AR attitude. (I still resent the fact that one of their activists broke the AR-view of my Enclosed Monocycle, even if my 'mancer, [[Kwang]], fixed it for me). |'''''[[Karel]]''''' <sub>Last captain of the Royal Bohemian Mountain Navy! </sub>}

{{Shadowtalk|Don't worry, Captain - I don't think we'll get in each other's way. I'm probably operating more of an order of magnitude below you, I don't bring more than an extra person or a handful of tech, dope or other expensive stuff across the border. For larger quantities, I'd rather find a subcontractor in your weight class than get such a big ship myself and deal with crew and the like. <br>

I've also had the pleasure of dealing with these Klabauters a few times since I've been here. They had my finest [[submarine]] drone on their conscience, the scumbags. And then they had the gall to offer to buy me the cargo of [[Telesma]] from Pomorya that I had on board, too! |'''''[[Niall Mackay]]''''' <sub>Human and machine are not opposites. </sub>}

{{Shadowtalk|Well then, all is well (or Soy-Magarine, in case there are no effectives left for the "Good, Westphalian Brand Butter<sup>(TM)</sup>" once again...). <br>

Because of Klabauterbund and you a diving drone with Telesma from the Baltic Tír robbed, and then tried to sell you back their own contraband.... yes, I know such things. It is a common bad habit that pirates and smugglers attack other pirates and smugglers. Is in West Africa and the Caribbean, however, even more widespread than here, on the North and Baltic Sea. - I must confess, however, that I have driven this modus operandi in the past, even if it's not nice to the colleagues...<br>

{{shadowtalk|Trying to sell stolen goods back to the person they were stolen from? - Sounds more like the questioned "[[Holstenzombies]]" than the Klabauterbund to me.... whereas, the "zombies" would probably have no idea how to hijack a submarine drone and especially how to crack it without ruining the cargo in the process...<br>

...but in general, the modus operandi of raiding other, independent smugglers is particularly common among the organized gangs that would like to push the independents out of the market: the [[Boyars]] allied with the Red Vory and the [[Polish Cape Smugglers|Polish Cape Smugglers]] come to mind off the top of my head, the [[Red Corsairs|Red Corsairs]] too.... since they started to break up into so many splinter groups, their honor as pirates is not that high anymore (sorry, [[Waterkant]]). - And the [[Vikings]] eh... for them - respectively for many of the [[Viking gangs]] - everything that is not also a [[Viking biker]] is practically fair game or potential prey.... |'''''[[Kwang]]''''' <sub>The VERY Korean Technomancer! </sub>}

{{Shadowtalk|Isn't that insanely stupid to sell someone something that you stole from them, beforehand? So I would organize some people and flatten the seller. If necessary, I would then pay them with the goods themselves and risk a zero business, just to make it clear that it is a stupid idea to want to steal from me. So... if I were a pirate, which of course I am not. |'''''[[Anna (Schockwellenreiter)|Anna]]''''' <sub>"The Matrix knows the answer to all questions. You just have to learn to recognize the signs and interpret the flow of information." </sub>}

{{shadowtalk|Well, it's nothing but classic blackmail. That's where you steal something and sell it back.

Giving the bums a beating sounds good, but I'd probably have to invest a lot more time and money to find and attack them than I've already lost. After all, we're talking about two somewhat larger ships and their crews.
(Of course, if I should happen to see one of the ships lying somewhere and still have some explosives with me...) |'''''[[Niall Mackay]]''''' <sub>Human and machine are not opposites. </sub>}}

{{Shadowtalk|If someone tried that on me, it would depend on what they stole from me. I would possibly even buy it back to get it back. <br>

After that, I would teach the person a lesson. Again, it would depend on how important what he stole was to me. |'''''[[Darkon]]'''''}}
