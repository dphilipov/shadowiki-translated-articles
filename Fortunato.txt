'''Fortunato''' was a younger [[ganger]] of the [[Seattle]]r "[[Cutters]]"-[[gang]].

==Biography==
{{Shx|2054}}, as part of "Team B" led by the orc [[Big Bad Bart]], he participated in a raid by the Cutters on a warehouse used as a meeting place by the [[Eighty-Eights]]-[[Triad]] at Pier 41 in the area known as the [[Hyundai]] piers, not far from the Kingdome.

On the way to the scene, he overplayed - as did his [[gang chummer]] [[Jack the Hammer|Jack "the Hammer"]] - his nervousness with pithy sayings and ''cool'' talk, to prove to himself and all who overheard that they were supposedly ''"cold as ice and smooth as silk"''.

==Relationships==
Larson, who had worked with him before, or broken a bottle or two, assumed that young Fortunato - as well as the other members of ''Team B'' and of his own ''Team A'' - would probably not shoot him in the back on Bart's behalf, though Jack certainly had no idea that Larson was in fact an undercover [[Lone Star]] investigator who had infiltrated the gang.

==Explanations==
{{Ref2|E1}} Since all non-humans in the novel have their [[metatype]] explicitly stated in each case, the article creator here assumes that Fortunato is a [[human]], as is Rick Larson.
