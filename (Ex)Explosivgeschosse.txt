'''(Ex)Explosive Ammunition''' (short: '''ExEx''', English: ''(Ex)Explosive Ammunition'') is a more stable form of explosive ammunition in use at least since the {{Shx|2060s|2060s}}.
{{Shadowtalk|...where "stable" in this context means that the risk of accidentally blowing off your own hand when loading the magazine of your [[weapon]] with the ammo or inserting a clip or a magazine with ExEx into the gun, or that the ammo spontaneously decides to explode due to the shock of carrying or transporting the loaded [[firearm]], is significantly lower than with ''ordinary'' explosive ammo...!|'''''Gun Runner''''' < Temporary Account >}}
{{Shadowtalk|...you still shouldn't get into a car accident - especially one where your vehicle catches on fire after carrambolage - with ExEx in the trunk...the ensuing fireworks could easily take very messy shapes...!|'''''Zero'''''}}
==Use==
In most, even rudimentarily civilized regions, (Ex-)Explosive is considered purely military [[ammunition]], and is therefore not legally available to ''Otto-Normal-Waffenschein-Besitzer''. While [[military]]s, paramilitaries, [[corporate forces]] and [[mercenaries]] (as well as less subtle [[runner]]s and hitmen) readily use ExEx, regular [[police]]s and ([[corporate]]) security forces tend to avoid such ammunition (even if they had access to it). - The increased risk of collateral damage and the associated damage to their image is simply not worth it!

Because of the high illegality and associated poor availability, black market prices for ExEx (just like for [[APDS]]) are usually correspondingly high.

In professional [[urban warfare]], ExEx is an "illegal ammunition type" according to the regulations, which can lead to disqualification of the warrior or team that uses it anyway. - Forces from the OC's sphere of influence, who illegally supplied the inmate team with ExEx, [[APDS]] and [[Grenade]]s at the 2063 benefit match of the "[[Borkum Jaildogs]]" against the "[[ADL Allstars]]", were unfortunately not deterred by this - just like the ''players'' of the "Jaildogs".  - In fact, this is how the outbreak of [[Vory v Zakone|Vors]] [[Pyotr Gargari]] (and [[Marcus Allenbrink]]s of the [[National Action|National Action]]) from the [[Grand Prison Borkum]] was made possible, while the armor-piercing ammunition cost the lives of several "Allstars" players including [[Abyssmal]] of the "[[Cyberzombies DÃ¼sseldorf]]" {{Ref|1}}.
{{Shadowtalk|Since in the international [[Urban Brawl]] [[Grenades]]s (and to a limited extent IEDs) are allowed, the use of banned ExEx - as well as [[APDS]] - ]] is unfortunately rarely sanctioned by [[DSKL]] and [[ISSV]] officials. - This has made the ''game'' (besides the end of the complete [[magic]] ban) even more deadly!|'''''[[Muffin]]'''''}}
