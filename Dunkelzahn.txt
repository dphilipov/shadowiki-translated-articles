'''Darktooth''' was arguably the most famous [[great dragon]] - and probably the most famous living creature of all - of the entire [[Sixth World|Sixth World]].

==Biography==
He lived from about 13,000 BC to August 9 {{shx|2057}}, held the rank of "Loremaster" within Dragon society, and was the seventh president of [[UCAS]].

He awoke on January 12 {{shx|2012}} at [[Cherry Creek Lake]] near [[Denver]] and proved to be by far one of the most (meta)human-friendly of the [[Dragons]].

{{shadowtalk|Which begs the question, how did he get there? - If the info I have from a reliable source is correct, in the [[Fourth World|Fourth World]] - as well as Ghostie - lived for a long time in the south of the Eastern European Plain. '''''Wyrm Watcher''''' - join [[DIVE]] Now!|59%}}
After virtually every news station had bothered to interview him, he gave the young journalist [[Holly Brighton]] the now-famous, over twelve-hour interview in which he explained much of the significance of the events of the [[Awakening]], [[magic]], and the ''new races'' to [[metahumanity]].

The said interview and Dunkelzahn's subsequent trideo broadcast &#8222;[[Wyrm Talk]]&#8220; made Dunkelzahn famous worldwide. During his interviews, the dragon used a total of three metahuman voice actors: [[John Timmons]] (2012-{shx|2022}}), [[Terri Ann Riberio]] ({{shx|2028}}-{shx|2039}}), and finally [[Nadja Daviar]] as his final voice actress.

In mid {{shx|2056}}, the UCAS Congress granted Dunkelzahn citizenship. The event, at which President [[Thomas Steele|Steele]] personally congratulated the dragon, was met with tremendous media attention. Dunkelzahn moved his primary UCAS residence to [[Prince Edward Island]] and registered secondary residences in [[New York]], [[Washington (Federal District of Columbia)|Washington FDC]], and [[Toronto]].

On {{Shx|March|15}}{{Shx|2057}}, '''Darktooth''' announced his candidacy for President of UCAS on Wyrm Talk. A tumultuous campaign ensued, with Dunkelzahn and Haeffner (who was nominated by [[Damien Knight]] for Vice) receiving massive support from [[Ares]] in the form of money, media hype, and lobbying {{Ref|3}}. Ultimately, the Dragon won the UCAS presidential election by a narrow margin. On {{Shx|August|9}}, he took office as the successor to interim president [[Betty-Jo Pritchard]]. He died a few hours later when his limousine exploded.  

His vice president [[Kyle Haeffner]] - like him, nonpartisan - also succeeded him as UCAS president, with Dunkelzahn's last spokeswoman Nadja Daviar serving as vice president. Dunkelzahn left behind a {{Shx|Dunkelzahns_Testament|Testament}} that caused a lot of stir and a lot more turmoil. This ultimately culminated in a [[corporate war]]. Among other things, his estate was used to create the [[Draco Foundation]], which was tasked with executing the will, as well as the [[Dunkelzahn Institute of Magical Research]] ([[DIMR]]), the [[Astral Space Preservation Society]], and a host of other foundations.

At the site of the assassination outside the Watergate Hotel in Washington, an astral rift was created between our world and the [[meta-levels]]. This so-called Watergate or [[Dark Tooth Rift]] developed into a pilgrimage site for followers of Dark Tooth, the curious, political agitators, and magic researchers. Especially for the latter, however, the Darkfang Rift was very dangerous, and in the [[Year of the Comet]] numerous [[ghost]]s, the astral form of the dragon [[Ghostwalker]], and finally the first [[Shedim]]s, among others, came out of the Rift.  
{{Shadowtalk|Yes, the Watergate... A lot of American history has been made here.|'''''Hotelconnoisseur'''''|64%}}
{{Shadowtalk|But none of those histories left anything as spectacular as the Dragon.|'''''[[Kiba]]'''''|64%}}
'''Big D''' was a special president in two ways: first, he was the first and so far only non-human president of the [[USA]] and UCAS, and second, he embodied the shortest presidential term to date.
{{shadowtalk|In addition, he was also the oldest president - of both the U.S. and UCAS!|'''''Sam's Son'''''|64%}}
{{shadowtalk|...not to mention that Dunkie was also the first '''blue'''' President!|'''''Alcoolizer'''''|64%}}

==Humanoid shape==
In his humanoid form, Dunkelzahn was around 6'3" tall and broadly built. He had olive skin, curly brown hair, and metallic blue-silver eyes with unnatural black pupils. He always seemed young and had a perfectly proportioned body, like Michelangelo's David.

==Research==

===Life extension and immortality===
Dunkelzahn researched ways to prolong the lives of metahumans or even give them immortality. To this end, he also maintained contact with several other researchers, one of them [[Mareth'riel Salvail]]. {{Ref|4}}

==Shadowtalk==
Under the [[persona]] "'''The Big 'D''''", he regularly commented in the [[Matrix]] and [[Shadowland Node]], among other places. Other Shadowtalkers also frequently shortened his name to '''Big D'''' on [[Matrix portal]]s forums.

In fact, Dunkelzahn is said to have spent a lot of time in the Matrix, and he often made cryptic comments on [[Shadowland]] about various files or engaged in a repartee with another user named [[Laughing Man]]. The most remarkable insight, however, the dragon gave us rather involuntarily. In a Matrix chat room, he held a conference of sorts with a round of illustrious individuals, including Laughing Man, about the infamous "[[Aztlan]]" file. A transcript of their conversation was added to the file by unknown [[otaku]]s.

Darktooth also {{shx|2054}} provoked a crash of the [[Seattle]]r [[Shadowland BBS]] to trigger an emergency file dump of the "[[Tir Tairngire (Sourcebook)|Tir Tairngire]]" file into the [[Nexus]] before anyone could remove his comments from the file.

==Trivia==
The access icon of [[Saeder-Krupp]]'s [[Global Grid|global grid]], the [[Saeder-Krupp Overworld]], shows a dragon, but it would not be [[Lofwyr]] as initially expected, but was actually modeled after Dunkelzahn. This one, however, has been softened a bit to make it look softer {{Ref|5}}.
