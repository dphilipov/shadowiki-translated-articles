The '''63 minutes'''' is a cocktail lounge within the [[Berlin]]'s [[Metropolis Arcology]], located below the "[[Masterman]]", a multi-story restaurant with a [[coffin hotel]] arranged around it.

==Name==
The name comes from the [[USA|American]] Metropolis]] revision of the {{WP|Metropolis_(film)|Movie Metropolis}}. In which the plot lines and with them the message of the film were completely changed. In this solid piece of [[corporate]] propaganda of the earliest days, Fredersen is called "Masterman", and 63 minutes of film plot - after which the "[[63 minutes]]" is named - have been lost to this day, despite all reconstruction attempts by the [[Murnau Foundation]].

==Description==
Both the "63 minutes" and the "[[Masterman]]" located above it, separate from the cocktail lounge per se, but still somehow belonging to it, are not very popular due to a somewhat unsuccessful conception - who wants to watch people just crawling out of their sleeping coffin while sipping cocktails (or eating in the restaurant) - and are on the verge of closing in anno '71. - However, the "63 minutes" is considered a popular spot for conspiracy theorists, and not only concerning the missing 63 minutes.
{{Shadowtalk|By the way, the {{WP|Cuba_Libre|Cuba Lîbres}} here are definitely three or even four classes better than in the "[[Bay of Pigs]]", and thus probably the best served in all of corporate Berlin...|'''''Alcoolizer'''''}}
{{shadowtalk|But that speaks less for the "63 minutes" than against the quality of Berlin's bartenders.... In good ol' [[Havana]] or elsewhere in [[Cuba]], in the [[Caribbean]] or on the [[Latin American]] mainland, no bartender would dare to offer what runs here under "Cuba Lîbre" to anyone...|'''''[[KPler]]''' Workers of all countries unite ... mañana.''}}
