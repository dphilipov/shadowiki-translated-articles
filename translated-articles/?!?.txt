The '''?!?''' was {{shx|2062}} the hottest club in [[New York City]] in the [[UCAS]].

Called just ''that club on 61st Street'' by local residents, it was cited by [[Wally Nguyen]], a reporter for the [[hostzine]]'s Spotlight, as proof that scene and style never left the Hudsonriver city despite the {{Shx|2005}} earthquake and [[corporate]] domination. The club is a magnet for celebrities, celebrities, celebrities and [[sim starlets]]s of all kinds, and the line of those seeking entry at the entrance - often in vain - becomes quite long every late night after eight o'clock, resulting in corresponding waiting times.

Nguyen describes the interior as "bold and daring, with symbols on every corner," and claims that even the design of the toilets is really cool. - That all this is not cheap, and a visit to "?!?" can empty the guest's [[credstick]] pretty rapidly over the course of an evening, should hardly come as a surprise.

In the mid-2070s, this club still exists, and - amazingly enough - it is still one of the absolute in addresses, although the name has been changed to '''!?!''', and the paraphrase '''the club that is too cool to have a name''' is often used. Contributing to the - as many say - unique ambience, in addition to the black and white interior and AR displays with the eponymous punctuation marks, are the performances by controversial artists and bands deliberately selected by the management, which includes [[SURGE|geSURGEte]] Musicians, [[Technomancers]] and [[AI]]s posing as musicians or [[Ghosts]]. - Prices here - as for everything in Manhattan - have also risen dramatically since the mid-2060s, of course, and the club boasts a 1,000 [[nuyen]] drink called "Afterlife," composed of the world's finest spirits and occasionally derisively paraphrased by critics as an "ode to excess."
