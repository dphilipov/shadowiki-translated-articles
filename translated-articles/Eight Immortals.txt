The '''Eight Immortals'''' - short '''8-I''' - were a band that played a ''neo-Maoist raga metal sound''.

They lost any following among fans and disbanded after {{Shx|2048}} it was revealed that lead singer [[Tony Li]], by means of a number of hired [[magicians]], was manipulating the audience of his concerts through [[magic|magic]] [[Magic category manipulation|manipulation]] to go full on their music. After the [[magician]] [[Sandra Willowfall]], herself a bassist in the band "[[Til Es Hault]]", along with an undercover [[Lone Star]]s agent, made sure that the scandal broke and Tony Li and his [[Wage Mages]] were arrested while still off stage by [[FBI]] Special Agents]], the music careers of the other band members were logically ruined once and for all. While Li himself possessed magical talent, even when he additionally relied on hired [[Magically Gifted|magically gifted]] [[magically gifted|magically gifted]] personnel, it is not so clear in the case of the other musicians of 8-I, as they were charged (using the ''RICO act'') only with ''conspiracy'' and ''obstructing the investigating authorities''.

Since then, at any rate, even the slightest suspicion that a musician is helping his popularity with magic means the certain end of the career for the rock star in question and - if present - his entire band as well.
