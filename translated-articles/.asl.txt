'''.asl''' - {{Shx|2073}} still going by the [[persona]] "'''Assel''''' - is a [[hacker]] or [[decker]] and a member of the [[Berlin]] [[Matrix gang]] of the "[[Hackbirds]]".

==Position==
At the time of the "[[Berlin (sourcebook)|Berlin]]" upload, the individual known as "Assel" was one of the four [[gangers]] of the "Hackbirds" matrix gang listed as leading, known ''important members'' in a [[Sternschutz]]' "gang report" at the time {{Ref|1}}.

{{Shx|2080}}, at the time of the release of the "[[Datapulse: Berlin]]", he is - in contrast to his then [[gang chummers]]s "[[Zion (Hackbirds)|Zion]]", "[[Celine (Hackbirds)|Celine]]" and "[[Dumas (Hackbirds)|Dumas]]" - still around, which according to [[.rez]]' words were mercilessly filtered out in the course of the new [[Matrix]] protocols of {{Shx|2075|'75}}, as they were either among the script kiddies or among the legacy [[Decker]]s who couldn't adapt quickly enough, even if according to his own statement he is no longer among the ''important members'' respectively the top leadership of the [[gang]] around gang leader [[.sphinx]] {{Ref|2}}.

==Appearance==
If the picture .asl posted for self-promotion purposes in the course of uploading the shadow file "[[Berlin 2080]]" matches his real appearance, he is either an [[elf]] or an [[orc]], possesses (at least) one [[data jack]] and extensive, colorful [[tattoo]]s on the back of (at least one of) his hands, including part of the fingers affecting his hand, as well as - apparently - equally colorful facial tattoos in the form of geometric patterns. He wears rather ''retro'' looking [[data glasses|data-]] or [[smart glasses]] with round lenses and probably habitually wears a baseball cap {{Ref|4}}.

===Persona===
The persona icon of .asl is a pitch black brushwood man with four arms and eyes that glow like dark coals. {{Ref|6}}

==Matrix activities==
.asl enriches various German-language [[Shadowfile]]s as well as articles on "[[SRB - Shadowrun Berlin]]" with his [[Shadowtalk]] comments.

In 2080, he is - along with [[.rez]] and [[.krah]] as well as [[Anne Archiste]] and six others - one of the moderators of the [[SRB node]]s {{Ref|3}} taken over from the "Hackbirds".

In the shadow file "[[Berlin 2080]]" published in Arachnet in October 2080, he placed an advertisement offering himself and his services as a contact for [[Runner]]s who would be new to Berlin, deck support for [[Runnerteam]]s without [[Deckers]], and potential buyers for [[Paydata]]s {{Ref|4}}.

He also - as he openly admitted in a comment on this shadow file - broke into [[Daemonika]]s label "[[Black Pirate Records]]" as a hacker to steal or copy unreleased tracks there. In the process, he found a folder called "[[Colcha]]" on the home system of the label's boss, [[Max Statuseff]], which, however, only contained encrypted chat logs that, according to him, would not have interested him, and which he therefore would not have decrypted and read {{Ref|5}}.

===Notes:===
That "asl." is identical with "Assel" is a logical conclusion of the article creator based on his and .rez' statements in "Datapuls: Berlin", and meanwhile (02/17/2021 RJ) confirmed.
