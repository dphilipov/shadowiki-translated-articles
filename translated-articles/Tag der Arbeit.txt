'''Labor Day'''' is a holiday that is celebrated with many events, especially in [[Berlin]].

==History==
In the past, there have often been significant riots on Labor Day. The most infamous was probably the [[First of May 2076|May Massacre]] of {{Shx|2076}}, where protesters were surrounded and shot. Since then, the situation has improved considerably thanks to [[Berlin police freedom]], but riots still happen every now and then {{Ref|1}}.

==Description==
In Berlin, many demos traditionally take place on the first of May. In [[Xhain]] one celebrates the so-called "[[MyFest]]" and in many clubs one celebrates the [[Dance into May]], while [[S-K Tempelhof]] celebrates a folk festival called [[Neuk√∂llner Maientage]] {{Ref|2}}.
