The '''162s''' are a [[gang]] in [[Seattle]].

==Term==
The gang named itself after a legal provision for the legal protection of [[ghouls]]s, ''[[Special Order 162]]'', which at its time in [[Chicago]] led to the establishment of the [[Cabrini Refuge]], and was repealed after less than a year in the wake of massive protests.

==Members, Turf, Colors & Symbol==
The gang is, unsurprisingly, a pure ghoul gang operating in [[Redmond]]. Their gang colors are blood red and brown. Their symbol is three clawed slashes below the bloody dripping number "162".

==Activities==
The "162s" gang has a profitable business relationship with the [[organ trafficking]] ring [[Tamanous]]: The gang's ghouls roam the [[Barrens]], hunting for victims, feeding healthy victims to Tamanous as "volunteer" organ donors, while the rest end up as meals. From the organleggers, the ghoulish [[gangers]] are rewarded with the leftovers and unusable organs that are worthless to their ripperdocs, as well as some cash with which to buy [[weapons]] and [[equipment]].

Regardless, the gang is among those who frequent the [[Funhouse (Urubia)|Funhouse]] of [[Dragoness]] [[Urubia]], where they - apparently - abide by the house rules there, that the landlady does not tolerate any violence among her ''guests'' under her roof.

==Competition==
Due to their ''business model'' the "162s" are in direct competition with the mixed-race gang of "[[Disassemblers]]" from [[Downtown (Seattle)|Downtown]], who are organ robbers and also work for Tamanous.

==Copycats==
In the mid-2070s, several ghoul packs operate in Chicago - the former [[Bug City]] - several ghoul packs are operating in Chicago - the former [[Bug City]] - using signs and colors of the "162s", and actively hunting (meta-)humans, making life in the ''Windy City'' even more difficult for ghouls seeking peaceful coexistence with non-[[Infected]]s. - However, they do not seem to have any connections to the Seattle "162s".
