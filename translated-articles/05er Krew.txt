'''05er Krew''' was the name of one of the countless, nameless gangs of children and youths, which in the Turkish-influenced precariat districts of the former Rhineland-Palatinate capital for [[Murad Hüseyin Ozbey|Ozbeys]] [[Mainz]]s [[Gray Wolf Maffiya|Wolves]] did the [[drek]] work, desperately trying to earn the recognition of the ''Godfather of Mainz''. In the spring of {{Shx|2078}}, they met their untimely, bloody fate far too soon when they were wiped out by [[go-gangers]]s of the "[[A666]]" motorcycle gang in a raid on a [[Pasha (kebab)|kebab store]] in Mainz's old town.

==Term==
The gang's self-chosen name, or Krew, derives from Mainz's long-established [[soccer]]club "{{WP|1._FSV_Mainz_05|1. FSV Mainz 05}}", which, like Mainz itself, is long past its prime.
{{Shadowtalk|...and whose run-down, [[Stadion am Bruchweg|altes Stadion]] in downtown Mainz is now used by the [[city warriors]] of my team, the "[[Black Barons Mainz|Mainzer Black Barons]]", for live broadcasting of our matches as part of public viewing events, as well as for our public trainings and victory celebrations! - By the way: While some of the "A666"-Rockers were quite good warriors back then, none of the Turkish gangkiddies we're talking about here, who IMHO are actually still too young to even watch the city war, ever even made it to the Ultra-[[Warmonger]], let alone made it to trial training or even to the team! - Just saying...|'''''[[Tattoo (City Warrior)|Tattoo]]''''' |67%}}
{{Shadowtalk|...while Mainz is in professional soccer 2080/81 his team in the [[Rhein-Hessen-Liga]] - "[[1. FC Mainz-Wiesbaden]]" - has to share with the unloved, rich sister city [[Wiesbaden]]! - Hard to bear for die-hard Mainz fans...!|'''''[[Coach]]'''''}}

==Members==
The "05er Krew" included, in addition to the young, Turkish [[Hobgoblin]] [[Abdul Yesilbörek]] and his three human brothers and his one orcish brother, a maximum of just under a dozen other, Turkish youths and younger adolescents.

==Fate==
The "05 Krew" lost several [[gangers]] in succession. One was - after a failed attempt to stab it in the back - by the well-known traveling [[street samurai]] "[[ice man]]" [[geeked]], and another died of what must have been Bliss stretched a bit too liberally with rat poison. A third succumbed to a fatal heart attack at 15 after buying a used [[adrenaline pump]] at [[Doktor Schnetzel]]'s Mainz branch. The second-hand [[Bioware]] implant had a fatal malfunction, promptly giving its new owner a heart attack once he activated it, and his [[gang chummer]]s of course had no idea how to administer first aid in such a situation.

The remaining gangers of the 05er Krew were killed - except for Abdul - in the spring of 2078, when a group of ''[[A666]]'' [[biker gang|motorcycle rockers]] attacked a [[Pasha (kebab)|kebab store]] ''protected'' by them, because the bikers wanted to collect the protection money there themselves in the future. Since Abdul Yesilbörek, who had suffered the most severe burn injuries in the robbery, subsequently posed as a ''prospect'' to the - at this point in his turn only from the [[Malaysia|Malay]] [[Troll]] [[Lan Wuilan]] - [[Greater Frankfurt]] ''chapter'' of the "[[Chinese Deadly Dwarfs]]", the "05 Krew" ceased to exist.

==Assets==
In addition to numerous [[knives]]s, the gangers also had scattered, cheap and inferior [[firearm]]s, and at least some of the older ones also owned motorcycles mostly of older construction.
