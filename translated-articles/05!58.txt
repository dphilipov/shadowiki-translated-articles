==Back cover text==
A brutal series of crimes in the greater [[Stuttgart]] area throws the population into a frenzy. [[Poolitzer]] senses a sensational story, because the perpetrator imitates the crimes of Jack the Ripper and other legendary criminals. Together with his [[Troll]] friend [[Ultra (Troll)|Ultra]], who wants to follow in his footsteps as a reporter, he does his own research and comes across the hypnotist [[Felix Ranjit Ficker|Ranjit]], whose performance in a Ludwigsburg nightclub ended in a debacle.

Now the task is to find the unknown man and awaken him from his trance in order to stop the killing. Poolitzer almost thinks he has reached his goal, when it turns out that Ranjit is not at all who he seems to be...
