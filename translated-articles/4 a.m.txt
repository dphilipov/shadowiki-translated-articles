The '''4 a.m.'''' is a club in [[Dortmund]]. It is located in downtown Dortmund on the 35th floor of the new Helmut Kohl Tower. The 4 a.m. is a club aimed primarily at the middle class. It mainly hosts after-work parties. The club is known for the fact that [[wage slave]]s of various [[corporations]] meet here. In this respect, the club is no different from many others of its kind.

{{shadowtalk|The club wouldn't be worth mentioning if you didn't usually get the newest and most original [[drugs]] here. Here you can always find good party drugs and do business with dealers. By the way, this store is firmly [[Gasperi|in Italian hands]].|'''''[[Zo√© Bellerose|Rose]]'''''|64%}}
