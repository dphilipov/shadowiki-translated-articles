Elected were the representatives of the districts of electoral period I - [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], [[Gropiusstadt]], [[Marzahn-Hellersdorf]], [[Oranienburg]], [[Reinickendorf]], [[Schönwalde]] and [[Tegel]] - [[Mayor]], who are to represent their respective districts in the [[Berlin Council]] in the following three years. - The election of the third mayor, which would normally have taken place at the same time, was postponed without further explanation.

==History==

===Election campaign===
In Reinickendorf there was a peculiarity in this district election, in that the incumbent district representative [[Krzysztof Ronczewski]] was under quarantine due to [[Cognitive Fragmentation Syndrome|Cognitive Fragmentation Syndrome]]. Ronczewski was last represented in the Berlin Council by [[Tanja Abt]]. Since he could not run for re-election due to the quarantine, and Abt did not run either, the major [[ADL]] parties came into play instead, since the {{Shx|2072|2072er}} Amendments to the [[Berlin Treaty]]s have been increasingly trying to establish themselves in [[Berlin]] politics. The most promising candidates who stood for election were [[Mu'tazz Suhail Hakimi]] ([[PNO]]), [[Sofia Nordin]] ([[CVP]]), [[Serafina Pazak]] ([[USPD]]) and [[Myron Yegonov]] ([[ASU]]).

===Election results===
In Reinickendorf, Sofia Nordin of the CVP was able to prevail.
{{Shadowtalk|With this, Reinickendorf seems to be the first Berlin standard district in which - incomprehensibly for me - the traditional system of alliance-wide political parties with their local chapters prevailed... but I say one thing to you alliance politicians in your fancy party headquarters in [[Hannover]], [[Munich]] and [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] - just don't think that the alternatives will follow suit anytime soon: Rather, hell would freeze over before districts like [[Gropiusstadt]], [[Lichtenberg]] or [[Marzahn-Hellersdorf]] would appoint classical party politicians as their representatives in the council!|'''''[[Russian Standard Troll]]'''''<br/>{{talk symbol|arrow}} <small>...and here, in red [[Pankow]] - as well as over there, in the not less red [[Köpenick]] - one chooses, if at all, exclusively between communists of only marginally different coleur!</small>}}
