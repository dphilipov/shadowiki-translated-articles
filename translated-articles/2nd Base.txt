The '''2nd Base'''' was a metal and underground club near the university in [[Hannover]] {{Ref|1}}.

==History==
The club burned out completely in {{Shx|2071}} after being in business for over 60 years. According to official announcements, a short circuit in the wiring was responsible, causing a cable fire, though in the year of the [[Tempo Drug War]]s, this may not have been a pure coincidence.... {{Ref|1}}

{{Shx|2072|One year later}} the completely renovated and rebuilt pub then reopened on the evening of June 10 under the name "[[The Laboratory]]" with a completely new design and under new management {{Ref|1}}.
