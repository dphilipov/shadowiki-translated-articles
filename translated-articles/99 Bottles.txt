Bodies Are Stacking

Mob wars are ugly things, but not all ugliness is created equal. Things are going bad in [[Bangkok]], and one [[Yakuza]] leader named [[Shinoda Yoshinori]] has been receiving a series of unsettling messages: bodies of other members of his gumi, packaged and delivered in a decidedly unique fashion. If Yoshinori wants to preserve his gumi - and save his life - he's going to have to take action. Due to the depleted manpower in his gumi, he's ready to turn to [[shadowrunner]]s for help.

99 Bottles introduces Shadowrun's new Enhanced Fiction line, in which short stories are accompanied by information and statistics that allows you to incorporate elements of the story into your game. In this book, the story kicks off a short adventure that is presented with all the information [[gamemaster]]s and players need, from plot points to [[NPC]] stats to details of specific locations in the seething, energetic city of Bangkok. Let the new fiction set the stage for a plunge into one of the [[Sixth World's]] seamiest spots!

99 Bottles is for use with [[Shadowrun, Twentieth Anniversary Edition]]
