The '''99 Ronin'''' are a [[Bosozoku]]-[[Go-Gangs|Motorcycle Gang]] based in [[Berlin]] with close ties to the [[Yakuza]].

==Territory==
''Hometurf'' of the "99 Ronin" is [[Renrakusan]], the former Renraku corporate district of [[Prenzlauer Berg]].
{{Shadowtalk|Whereby they pull off their violent actions - for obvious reasons - less inside, than outside their home territory.... Anything else would also be rather stupid, as the loss of face - similar to the [[Renraku]]-[[corporation]] fanboys of the "[[Red Ronin]]" in [[Japan]]s [[Chiba]] and elsewhere - would fall back on their families if they were caught committing their [[crimes]] there...|'''''Renraku-Flop'''''}}
The exception to this rule is any muscle work in the service of the [[DÃ¼sseldorf]] [[Makahashi-gumi]] under [[Takeo Maeda]], whose executive body they serve as in Berlin.

==Members==
The [[gang]] has about 100 members (+ a significantly higher number of hangarounds, hangers-on and fanboys).

==Dangerousness==
The gang is very well financed (which can no longer be explained solely by the exorbitant pocket money of adolescent [[corporate scions]]) and has access to illegal [[weapons]] through its yakuza connections and - in the [[ADL]] - [[equipment]] that is almost impossible to obtain for mere street gangs.
