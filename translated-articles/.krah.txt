'''.krah''' is the [[persona]] of a female [[orc]] street kid and [[ganger]]s of the [[Berlin]]s [[Matrix gang]] [[Hackbirds]] {{Ref|1}}

==Biography==
Originally joined the "Hackbirds" at a very young age practically as a ''foundling'', and initially used by them only as a [[BTL]]/data chip courier and paid with scraps, .krah, with her parkours skills, engine monoblades, a ''found'' professional [[cyberdeck]], and a combination of quick perception, talent, cruzpe, and luck, developed into an enormously fast - and talented - [[hacker]]in and [[decker]]in {{Ref|1}}, respectively, both in the flesh world and in the [[VR]] of the new [[Matrix]].

She works on the side as a bargirl in the "[[Modem]]", the hacker pub of the "Hackbirds", which is hidden deep in the "Jewühl" of [[AGC-Siemensstadt]] {{Ref|2}}.

==Personal==
Her [[Shadowtalk]] comments still occasionally reveal a certain naivety, especially when it comes to economic and political connections and backgrounds beyond Berlin district politics {{Ref|3}} {{Ref|4}}, or sometimes give unreflected half-knowledge unchecked {{Ref|5}}, but this is probably forgivable in view of their youth and their ''uneducated'' background, and .krah is definitely capable of learning in this respect, too. {{Ref|3}} {{Ref|4}} [[Anti-metamensch]]e racists she - understandably - can't stand at all, and a NovaPuls article reproducing the corresponding remarks of [[Hannover]]aner [[PNE]] top man [[Hanno Wehr]] therefore caused her to ''vomit'' verbally on [[metaBEEP]] {{Ref|6}}. - On the other hand, some statements of hers - as well as of [[.rez]] - especially for her young age, sound downright frighteningly cynical {{Ref|7}}, and she is a self-confessed follower of the controversial talk show "SPLATTERTALK" with [[vampire]]celebrity [[Bella Lugosi]] on "[[Pulse-B]]" {{Ref|3}}.

'''Her''' neighborhood, according to her own statement, is the "Pückler-Kiez", in [[FKB]], where the "[[Initiative Autofreies Kreuzberg]]" is in charge, and cars and motorcycles have been banned because of it. {{Ref|8}}

==Matrix activities==
.krah enriches several German-language [[Shadowfile]]s as well as articles on "[[SRB - Shadowrun Berlin]]" and - via "Shadowbot"-App - also [[NovaPuls]] issues with Shadowtalk comments since the release of "[[Datapuls: Berlin]]".

In the introduction to the "[[Datapuls: Berlin]]", .rez introduced them - as well as himself, [[.spoof]] and [[.root]] - to the reader with a short biography paragraph including a picture. {{Ref|1}}

In 2080, she - along with [[.rez]] and [[.asl]] as well as [[Anne Archiste]] and six others - is one of the moderators of the [[SRB node]]s {{Ref|9}} taken over from the "Hackbirds".
