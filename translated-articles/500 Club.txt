The '''500 Club'''' is located in [[Cologne]]s city center. It is a classy club that only lets in people who are on a VIP list. Here the stars and starlets want to be among themselves. The music is up to date and the drinks are among the finest you can get. The security is discreet and ensures above all that the stars and starlets can be unmolested by paparazzos and fans. It's all very classily decorated and there are lounges where the stars and starlets can relax. There is always a long queue in front of the club as many try to get into the club. The club is run by a German man named Sebastian Kelm.

{{shadowtalk|A nice place to party among "his peers". This is where the B-list celebrities from Cologne meet. So all the nice ladies and gentlemen you know from the [[Trideo]]. They imagine a lot, but probably don't realize that none of the real stars take them seriously.|'''''[[Zo√© Bellerose|Rose]]'''''|68%}}
