'''2060 Munich''' is a [[Munich|Munich]] [[Stadtkrieg]]steam and ''Oberligist'' {{Ref|1}}.

==History==
===Teutonen-Cup-Qualifikation 2073===
{{Shx|2073}} "[[2060 München]]" tried to qualify for one of the starting spots reserved for ''amateurs'' in the [[Teutonen Cup 2073]], where the Munich team, considered "strong" by experts and media, met the "[[Stammheim Morituri]]" from the [[Stammheim|same-named]] [[Stuttgart]] district, who, however, were to have a few surprises in their squad {{Ref|2}}.

The {{Shx|4 June}} {{Ref|2}} {{Shx|2073}} was then, however, not a day for the city war amateurs from the [[Freistaat Bayern|bayerische]] State capital. Time and again, their shots went nowhere and hit windows and walls instead of the opponents from Stammheim JVA. Even Munich's ''striker'' [[Jacky Pavlov]] looked clumsy and unpracticed this time with her motorcycle, which usually seems to be like a second skin. The quite decent performance of the strong Stammheim team was therefore rewarded with a surprising victory over the hapless Munich team, so that instead of the upper league team, the inmate team qualified for the [[Teuton Cup]] {{Ref|3}}.

===2080s===
In the {{Shx|2080s}}, "2060 Munich", which had not taken its chance to pass the "Asphalt Cowboys" in a challenge by the "[[Cologne Maniaks]]" in the run-up to the [[Teutonen Cup 2076|Teutonen Cup 2076]] to be promoted to the [[DSKL]] via relegation, played in the Regionalliga Süd {{Ref|10}}.

====Season 2083/84: Game against "Phalanx Freising"====
On {{Shx|March|14}} {{Shx|2084}}, "2060 Munich" faced "[[Phalanx Freising]]" at the [[Laimer Stadtkriegs Arena]] {{Ref|11}}, which had shown a more than respectable performance in the [[Teutonen Cup 2081]], beating the "Asphalt Cowboys" and the "[[Black Barons Mainz]]" after all, before the Munich suburban club was eliminated against the "[[S-K Centurios Essen]]" {{Ref|12}}. - It was to be an encounter that left a special aftertaste in more ways than one: {{Ref|11}}

The [[human]]-like ''breaker'' [[Albert Alanson|Albert "Roadblock" Alanson]], playing for "2060 Munich", discovered a [[katana]] in a half-smashed closet in one of the dilapidated [[Laim]] apartment buildings, and seized it to go into hand-to-hand combat with it against the [[dwarf]]ic ''scout'' of the Freisingers who had pursued him into the former apartment, unaware of what he was about to unleash. However, the dwarf [[Klara Vati|Klara "Super Dad" Vati]] playing for "Phalanx" didn't give him a chance to do so, but shot him a full six times with her [[Ares Viper Slivergun]]. At point-blank range, his city warrior armor offered very little protection against the flechette [[ammunition]], so "Roadblock" went down, and it subsequently took him less than three minutes before he bled out, correctly marked as "deceased" by his armor's [[vital monitor]]. Vati then turned on her heel, and was about to leave the scene of the bloody event when something happened that neither she nor her downed opponent could have foreseen. A [[Shedim]] took possession of Alanson's dead body, forcing him to rise again. He rammed the [[sword]] he had still been holding in death through the dwarf's ribcage from behind, piercing her heart and injuring her left lung. Afterwards he let go of the [[Blade Weapon]], and additionally broke "Super Dad's" neck with his bare hands, before he now left the building {{Ref|11}} for his part.

The walking corpse ''ensouled'' by the Shedim made it two blocks before coming face to face with [[Aaron Zimmermann|Aaron "ZSKA" Zimmermann]], playing for "Phalanx Freising", who didn't hesitate but took him down with four shots from his [[Altmayr White Star]]. Stupidly, the [[Ghost]] from one of the [[Deep Metaplanes|Deep Metaplanes]] that had taken possession of the dead man was still unwilling to stay down, but made him rise again to go after "ZSKA". Fortunately for him, the 43-year-old [[elf]] and ex-[[soccer]] professional, playing as a ''hunter'' for Freising, was considerably more agile than the tottering dead man. He managed to dodge his killer hands and send him to the ground one more time with several shots from his [[gun]] from the [[Altmayr Waffen GmbH|Hause Altmayr]], which still wasn't enough for him to stay down. In the end, it took the "Phalanx" gunner and his [[MMG]] to finally take "Roadblock" and the extraplanar entity in his dead body out of the game, but this only succeeded when he was literally torn to shreds by the [[machine gun]] fire {{Ref|11}}.

In the end, "Phalanx Freising" won the match, which had not been stopped and had been broadcast live in its entirety by [[Bavaria Trid]]'s [[drones|cameradrones]] distributed in the war zone, and beat "2060 Munich" 7:5 {{Ref|11}}.

Afterwards, there was an investigation by the experts of [[PSI Aid]] to find out how it could be that a warrior who had undoubtedly perished in the match rose again a total of three times after actually fatal hits and, moreover, as a dead man, killed his "murderer" in turn. The investigation took two weeks, at the end of which the PSI Aid investigators and [[Forensic Thaumaturgy|Forensic Thaumaturges]] could say without a doubt that the [[Japanese]] sword in question had been the trigger of the terrible event: the blade was a highly illegal [[Magic Artifact|Dark Magic Artifact]] and also a very special [[Spirit Focus]]. This caused the dead body of anyone who died with this weapon in hand to automatically transform into a [[vessel preparation|prepared]] for [[inhabitation]] by a Shedim [[vessel preparation|prepared]] [[Ghost Vessel]] and, like a magnet, attracted the next of these dangerous and strange spirits to immediately take possession of it. - How the [[enchantment|enchanted]] Katana, however, could have gotten into the Laimer war zone, they had not been able to figure out either, according to PSI Aid spokesman [[Holger von Kauffungen]] {{Ref|11}}.

The responsible persons at the [[ISSV]] and the DSKL as well as the editor responsible at [[Bavaria Trid]] for the city war live broadcasts from the Lainzer Arena then decided after a short consultation that the game "Phalanx Freising" vs. "2060 Munich" would not be repeated. Rather, the game would be scored normally despite the irregular events, since "Phalanx" would have won it anyway with a score of 7:5. Moreover, since there was no indication that the club management of "2060 Munich" could have had anything to do with the appearance of the dangerous, enchanted sword in the war zone or even had advance knowledge of this event, the team was neither fined nor penalized with a point deduction. Instead, a 12-game suspension - purely symbolic and moot because of the latter's ultimate death - was imposed posthumously on Albert "Roadblock" Alanson for ''"illegal [[focus]] use in the war zone during a city war game"''. The question of which of the three Freising players involved would have the death of "2060 Munich" player "Roadblock" counted as a ''"firing"'' in the official statistics still required final clarification {{Ref|11}}, according to the words of league president Dr. [[Markus Braun]].

==Home arena==
Like the big ones, maintained by [[Renraku Europa]] and its local [[Private Police Service Provider|Private Police Service Provider]] of the [[Black Sheriffs|Black Sheriffs]] and the "[[Asphalt Cowboys Munich]]" and the "[[Bavarian Bayonets]]", "2060 Munich" plays its ''home games'' in the [[New Bavaria SimSinn]] stadium maintained by [[NeoNET]] and its [[New Bavaria SimSinn-Studios|Neuer Bavaria]] built [[Laimer Stadtkriegs-Arena]] in the cleared and walled former Munich district of [[Laim]]. - The (then) NeoNET subsidiary broadcast the games live {{Ref|1}} from there - disregarding the exclusive license of [[DeMeKo]] for city war broadcasts. The [[Bavaria Trid]] created by management buyout when NeoNET disintegrated has kept this practice {{Ref|11}}.
