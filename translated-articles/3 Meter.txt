'''3 Meters'''' is anno {{Shx|2072}} a local [[trough rock]] Formation from [[Puyallup]].

Their name obviously refers to the exorbitant height of [[troll]]s, or even the troll [[meta-variant]] of [[giant]]s, to which the musicians presumably belong. - Whether their fame will ever extend beyond the [[Seattle]]r [[Metroplex]], however, is uncertain....
