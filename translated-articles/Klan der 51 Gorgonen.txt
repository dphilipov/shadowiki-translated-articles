The '''Clan of the 51 Gorgons'''' (French: ''Clan des 51 Gorgones'') is a small [[triad]] in [[Marseille]] led by a [[Vietnam]]esen. It was allied with changing partners among the larger, internationally operating triads before first being the primary [[Olaya Cartel]] for [[Tempo]] in the year of the [[Tempo Drug War]], and then being forced into a vassal relationship by the [[Milieu Marseillais]].

==History==
The [[China|Chinese]] were once, when they were merely a larger, better organized [[gang]], affiliates of [[Russia|Russia]] in Marseille, and thus of the [[Vory]] branch there. They cut those ties, however, when they evolved into a true triad under the leadership of [[Michael N'Guyen]]. Instead, they sought cooperation with [[Wuxing]]'s Marseilles branch, and sought to foster (and profit from) the growth of the small, Chinese and Southeast Asian community in the southern [[city-state]]. Among other things, they carried out successful raids on convoys of [[Esprit]] and [[Z-IC]] in the ''[[La Fosse|Pit]]''. In an effort to find allies, they sought - and found - contact with the ''[[Ten Thousand Lions]]'' of [[Hong Kong]]. The latter sent emissaries to Marseilles to train N'Guyen's men, and to deepen business ties in the Pearl River Delta Free City, where the [[Kong chips]] of the "Lions" were produced, which N'Guyen's dealers sold.

Apparently, however, the partnership did not develop as the Vietnamese would have liked, as he ended the relationship, instead establishing business ties with Hong Kong's "[[Black Chrysanthemums]]." The latter recommended the "51 Gorgons" to their suppliers from the Olaya Cartel as local primary distributors for their novel [[BAD]] in the south of [[France]], and the [[South American]] [[Ghost Cartel]] gave the Triad - as it did its trading partners around the world - a taste of the [[drug]]. - Naturally, neither the milieu, as top dog of the Marseilles [[underworld]] and junior member of the [[Alta Commissione]], nor the prey [[Organizatsiya]] [[Natalya Mnouchkine]] was pleased to have simply been passed over in this deal. The milieu led by [[Pascal Angeloni]]s and [[Enzo Muntoni|Enzo "Mutagna" Muntonis]], with the help of [[Shadowrunner]]s, taught the Triad a few painful lessons before entering into direct negotiations with [[Luis Cordero]] and [[Filipe Munoz]] of the Olaya Cartel, reaching an agreement with the [[Latin American]]s and making N'Guyen an offer he could not refuse. As a result, N'Guyen's "Clan of 51 Gorgons" has been a de facto vassal and junior partner of the Milieu since the Tempo year of 2071....

==Relationships==
In the past, the "51 Gorgons" were allied first with the southern French Vory and then with the Hong Kong "10,000 Lions". Both relationships were each cut in favor of new alliance and trading partners.

The "Clan of 51 Gorgons" is loosely allied with the "Black Chrysanthemums" in Hong Kong and [[Macau]], which also gave it trade relations with the Olaya Cartel. As a result of the vassal relationship with the milieu, there is now a ''good working relationship'' with the latter, albeit not entirely voluntary. How the change in allegiances has affected the Vietnamese triad's relationship with Wuxing is uncertain.
{{Shadowtalk|Notwithstanding that the ''Gorgones'' themselves are among the smaller players, they also have, in turn, vassal gangs on the street, such as the ''[[Fists of the Dragon]]'' in the [[Gang Neighborhood of Nice|Gang Area]] of [[Nice]], who do such things as distribute dope or chips to end users or muscle... and end up as cannon fodder when the clan messes with bigger players like Mnouchkine's Marseilles Vory. {{Ref|10}}|'''''Social Adepts'''''}}
{{Shadowtalk|}Since the "51 Gorgons" are quasi-vassals of the milieu, they sometimes provide their ''capi'' with members such as the former Vietnamese business exchange student [[Taj Dong Leong]] from [[Hanoi]], who was expelled from [[Université Nice Sophia Antipolis|Uni]] for organizing a fraudulent Ponzi scheme in Nice. - Even though [[Pascal Angeloni|Gros Pascal]] and [[Michael N'Guyen|N'Guyen]] definitely had better ideas than to send this young man of all people to [[Freiburg]] in 2081, to act there as a negotiator between the [[biker gangs|bikers]] of the [[Troll Republic of the Black Forest|Schwarzwald]] ''chapter'' of the "[[Desperados MC]]", the [[Stuttgart]] [[Go-Gangers]] of the "[[Stuttgart Chromeshards|Chromeshards]]" and their own resident, the [[ogre]] [[Lisandru Cesari]], to act.... That he would fail with this mission and that it would not end well for him was actually quite predictable! {{Ref|11}}|'''''[[MobWatch]]''''' - it's all kept in the Family}}
===Enemies===
Having not only renounced their former alliance with the Russians, but also serving as soldiers for the milieu in its ongoing war with the Vory in the south of France, the "Clan of 51 Gorgons" has created bitter and very vindictive enemies in the Russian mobsters, who also extend this enmity to Asian gangs allied with or leaning toward the "Gorgons".

The relationship with [[corporations]]s robbed by the Triad thugs in the past, such as [[Esprit Industries]] and [[Zeta-ImpChem]], is also likely to be markedly hostile.
