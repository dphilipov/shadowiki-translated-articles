The 16th incarnation of the '''Dalai Lama''' is sought by the [[Tibet|Tibetan]] [[Lotus Throne Sect]] and was in any case {{Shx|2064}} still unknown....
The 16th incarnation of the [[Dalai Lama]] is the head of state of [[Tibet]].

==Biography==
{{Shx|2063}} / {{Shx|2064}} was still being searched for the 16th Dalai Lama after his 15th incarnation {{Shx|2060}} / {{Shx|2061}} passed away {{Ref|1}}. The state oracle of Tibet, [[Nyimabumo]], prophesied that the 16th Dalai Lama would be the bridge to the outside world of Tibet {{Ref|2}}. According to this prophecy, the search for the new incarnation was entrusted to the [[Lotus Throne Sect]], which went all over the world to look for it {{Ref|1}}.

However, this search was to be anything but easy, because at the same time there were reports of various conflicts. For example, there was a shooting at the [[Takya Monastery]] in [[Bellevue]], which follows Tibetan Buddhism. Further, there was a whole series of violent acts against Tibetan communities in a number of Asian cities, though these were dismissed as old Han-Tibetan conflicts. It seems, however, that the [[Triads]] were specifically responsible. The cult also reportedly sought refuge in [[squatter]] communities in the lower levels of the [[ACHE]], where mostly [[metahumans]] and refugees reside {{Ref|1}}.

===Audience===
{{Shx|2070}} the Dalai Lama seems to have been found by now, as the [[Artificial Intelligence]] [[Bai Li]], who converted to [[Buddhism]], invited to an audience with his holiness {{Ref|3}}.
