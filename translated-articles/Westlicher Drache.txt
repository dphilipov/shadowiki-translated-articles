'''Western dragon''' (''Draco occidentalis'') are probably the best known of the [[dragon]] species.
==Basics==
Western dragons are native to [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. They have a lizard-like build and six limbs, which are formed as a pair of wings, a pair of arms with surprisingly dexterous hands for their size, and a pair of legs. The head and torso are on average 20m long, to which is added 17m of tail. The shoulder height is 3m and the wingspan is an amazing 30m. An adult Western Dragon weighs about 20 tons and its dentition has 40 teeth. As with all four major species of Dracoforms, there are [[Great Dragons]] among the western members of their species that are significantly larger than their common adult counterparts, with more Great Western Dragons than Great Dragons of any other species!

Just like the [[Eastern Dragons|Eastern Dragons]], the Western ones are not [[Critters]] at all, but rather highly intelligent beings and incredibly powerful [[Mages]], superior to [[Humans]] and [[Metahumans]] in virtually all respects. Many of them pursue complicated schemes, power games, and intrigues, some of which date back as far as the [[Fourth World|Fourth World]]. While some Western Dragons have introduced themselves upon their [[Awakening]] like the monsters they were first thought to be, others in the [[Sixth World|Sixth World]] have used the gold and jewels from their respective [[Dragon Hoard|Hort]] to act as [[corporate]] investors, acquiring significant stakes in large corporations. The Grand Dragon [[Lofwyr]], owner and CEO of [[Saeder-Krupp]] since 2037, is the best known of the dragon corporate owners, owning the largest and most powerful of the Triple-A cons. - The Welsh grand dragons [[Celedyr]] and [[Rhonabwy]] - involved in [[Transys-Neuronet]] and [[HKB]] - and [[Nightmaster]], who controlled the [[Frankfurt Banking Association]] before his death by Lofwyr's claws, are other examples of dragons in the modern corporate world. [[Ugly]], on the other hand, was a rather unusual Western Dragon, as he worked for a corporation run by [[metahumans]] in [[Seattle]] - [[UniOil]] - [[Security Chief]].

Other Western Dragons - including major ones - have, however, chosen ''careers'' outside of metahuman society: both [[Alamais]] - Lofwyr's brother - as well as [[Kaltenstein]], who fought for the environment and metahuman rights, and [[Sirrurg]], the Destroyer use the means of terrorism. [[Całożerca]] and [[Booryazmei]] are also characterized by cruel and brutal actions.

Other Western Dragons - such as [[Ghostwalker]], who usurped rule over [[Denver]], and [[Schwarzkopf]], who rose to rule over the [[Council of Marienbad]] - gained a position of political power more or less by force, but were ultimately accepted by their metahuman subjects. The same is true of [[Hestaby]], who was first patroness of the people of [[Free State of California|Northern California]] and later a member of the [[Council of Princes]] of [[Tir Tairngire]].

The most famous Great Western Dragon, however, was undoubtedly [[Darktooth]], who legally got himself elected president of [[UCAS]], and even after his death, his {{Shx|Darktooth's_Testament|Testament}} shook up the entire corporate world, exerting tremendous influence worldwide to this day.
