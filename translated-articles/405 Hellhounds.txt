The '''405 Hellhounds''' are a (majority) [[human|human]] [[Go gang]] in [[Seattle]], who in terms of size and importance, are significantly behind ''[[Ancients]]'' and ''[[Spikes]]'' {{Ref|1}}.

==History==
When [[Knight Errant]] attempted to pit the [[Elf|elfish]] "Ancients" and [[Troll]]s from the "Spikes" against each other, giving both sides a load of [[Weapons of Ass Destruction|military weapons]] each from [[Ares Arms]], the "405 Hellhounds" were ultimately the winners: Over the course of the young [[Kellan Colt]]'s first [[Shadowrun]]s, black-ops specialist [[Midnight]], who as a member of [[CATCo]]'s [[Seraphim]] naturally set out to sabotage [[Ares]]' plans, made sure that at least one of the weapon loads fell into the hands of the [[Go-Gangers]]s of the "Hellhounds" instead. This upgraded them, and allowed them to increasingly annoy KE, whose Seattle HQ was on their turf.... {{Ref|2}}

==Term==
The gang's name derives from two Hellhounds (''English Hellhounds'') that a former boss of the gang, [[Eddie Tango]], kept as pets. {{Ref|1}}

==Customs==
===Colors==}
Their colors are red and orange, they paint their motor carriers with flame motifs, and the [[Gangers']] logo depicts a [[Hellhound]] with its head wreathed in flames {{Ref|1}}.

===Initiation ritual===
The gang initiation involves for each future "Hellhounds" ganger - in addition to receiving a [[tattoo]] of the flaming hellhound head - a violent attack on a motorist on I-405, whose [[vehicle]] must be ''taken down''. - This ritual is so well known that Knight Errant now purposefully increases his presence on the road section in question on the nights in question to protect innocent road users {{Ref|3}}.

==Territory==
They control the northern axis of 405th Street through [[Bellevue]].

==Activities==
The [[Gangers]] form a sort of express courier service. When they are not delivering packages - which usually contain some sort of illegal goods - they stage illegal motorcycle races or murderous tournament fights in the saddle of a motorcycle. The [[gang]] spends as much time defending their turf as they do their delivery service, regularly clashing with the "[[Leather Devils]]" who rule Interstate I-90, which intersects 405th Street {{Ref|1}}.
{{shadowtalk|Although they are almost all Homo Sapiens sapiens, and know this one and that one are not orphans but hardcore go-gangers, the "Hellhounds" are by no means [[anti-metahuman]]s racists and [[Humanis-Policlub|Humanis]]s, like the "[[Night-Hunters]]". - Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have done the rebuilding job on Eddie Tango's bike...Ne? {{Ref|4}}|'''''[[Roller]]'''''|68%}}
By 2078, however, Sister Roller's relationship with the "Hellhounds" is likely to have deteriorated drastically {{Ref|4}}, as they now hire themselves out as drivers for [[Bunraku]] prostitutes to finance their need for motorcycle spare parts and ammunition, and ''safely'' drive them from the respective establishments to private sex parties and back, and in recent times have even acquired their own ''stable'' of Bunraku girls to host respective parties themselves along the stretch of road claimed as Turf. {{Ref|3}}
