__NOTOC__

A variety of colloquial words and technical terms are used in [[Shadow]]. Even though some terms have become fashionable through the [[Trideo|Trid]], or have found their way into the language through former security forces and military personnel, you can definitely recognize [[Shadowrunners]] by their jargon.

{{shadowtalk|So [[chummer]], if you hear someone talk like a fucking shadowrunner, you can assume they're a fucking [[poser]]. There are few people who memorize this [[drek]]s page here, and the [[shadows]]s also differ from drek kaff to every other damn backwater drek kaff. But certainly someone who is a [[Runner]] will understand you if you let the words sink in, and sometimes you gain trust from your counterpart because of it. CA [[Granny]] and don't forget the fucking cursing!|'''''Running is Wild!'''''}}
