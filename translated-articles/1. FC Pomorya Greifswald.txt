'''FC Pomorya Greifswald''' is a professional [[soccer]] club from [[Greifswald]] in [[Pomorya]], which - given the pro-elf [[racism]] prevailing in the [[Elf nation]] on the [[Baltic Sea]] - practically exclusively [[Elf|elfish]] players (although just as with [[Tír na nÓg]]'s national team, the [[metahuman]] quota is not applied to Pomorya's elven footballers either). {{Ref|2}}

{{Shx|2063}}/{Shx|2064|64}}, "FC Pomorya Greifswald" became champions of the [[Mitteldeutsche Liga|Mitteldeutsche Liga]], qualifying for participation in the [[Cup of Champions]]. {{Ref|2}}
{{Shadowtalk|In October {{Shx|2081}}, "1. FC Pomorya Greifswald" - after a dry spell in the {{Shx|2070s|2070s}} - again for the top ranks of the Central German League, even if the "[[1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig]]" could defend its place at the top of the league table with a 2-0 in injury time against the ''Greifen-Elfen'', which the [[Leipzig]]ers owed virtually exclusively to their outstanding goalkeeper [[Boris Hummel]]! {{Ref|10}}|'''''Hoyzer 4.1'''''|64%}}
