The '''289s''', also known as the '''Easy Money Gang''', are a [[Hong Kong]]s [[Triad]].

==Building==
The triad is not so much a monolithic organization as a coalition of various Chinese [[gangs]] in Yau Sim Mong and [[Mong Kok]], such as the [[Gold Tigers of Portland Street]], which includes [[Wizgang]]s of untrained but talented [[Wujen]]s, as well as [[Matrix]] and [[Hacker]] gangs. - Even a [[technomancer]] guild - the "[[100100001]]" - is incorporated into the Triad anno 2072 as part of the 289s.

===Officers===
The Triad's leadership circle of officers consists of representatives from each member gang, with no gang having more than one member in the inner circle. The highest rank within the Easy Money Gang, that of ''Shan Chu'', is held by a young woman - [[Chai-Chai Feng]] aka [[CeeCee]] - [[CeeCee]], who at the age of 28 had already earned her way to the top with some successful and lucrative rackets, and who is said to be a social [[adept]] ...

==Symbolism==
The [[gangers]] use their own rapid and complex sign language of gang hand signs, which they have evolved from the ancient triad signs. The symbolism of Chinese numerology is found not only in their name - 289s sounds phonetically like "Fast Money and Long Life" in Chinese - but also as tattoos and on members' clothing. In general, the members of the gangs are known for interpreting the old triad customs in a modern way and adapting them to their own needs.

==Criminal Activities==
The focus of the 289s - as the epithet "Easy Money Gang" suggests - is primarily on making quick and easy money through criminal enterprises, similar to the [[North American]] "[[Cutters]]" gang. Accordingly, the triad is active in, among other things, the trafficking of pirated copies, media piracy, gang theft and [[fencing]], the production and distribution of counterfeit branded products, as well as the areas of protection racketeering, identity theft, and fraudulent gambling including those in [[AR]] and VR. In addition, they also produce simple, cheap [[SimSense recordings]] in which they have the members of the triad portray themselves as modern metropolitan heroes, and are very popular on the streets of Mong Kok.
{{Shadowtalk|Whereas in these home-cooked [[Kong chips]], they distort reality badly: namely, these [[gang kiddies]] are not afraid to raid [[Yokogawa]] ambulances and fire trucks to steal [[medicines]], medical equipment, and [[weapons]] from emergency personnel and HTR teams, which are then sold on the black market... irresponsible bastards!|'''''Chan the Fireman'''''}}
{{Shadowtalk|With this, they're slowly but surely starting to rub the [[Red Dragons]] the wrong way... and when the time comes, and the greedy bastards finally end up as a snack, I won't say anything more about it than "Bon appetit, [[Lung]]!"|'''''[[Chin-Fo]]''''' ...some deals are personal after all!}}
The wizgangs of the "289s," who operate primarily in Yau Ma Tei, also engage in [[talislegging]] and the trade of cheap, magical lucky charms - in addition to trickery using [[illusion spells|illusion]] and [[manipulation spells]].
