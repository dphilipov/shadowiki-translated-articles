'''8-Ball''' is the street name of a black [[dwarf]] who was part of the mass of propertyless and [[SIN]]-less on the streets of [[Seattle]]. He had grown up in the [[squatter]] community of the ''[[crypt]]'' in the [[Puyallup Barrens]], and had learned certain basics of hand-to-hand combat from appropriate ''teachers'' there at a young age.

One night, however, he had a near-fatal run-in with a - drunk - member of the [[Humanis Policlub]]s at a [[Stuffer Shack]] near his home. The [[Policlub]] member had first accused the store's clerk of selling his [[Soyfood|Soybeer]] to children, and then forced the (adult) dwarf to ''dance'' by firing the eight bullets from his revolver directly at his feet. - Subsequently, however, the hooligan and [[anti-metahuman]]e racist was brought down by the later 8-ball with a knife thrust to the leg while he was busy reloading.... and immediately shot with a [[Remington Roomsweeper]] by the "Stuffer Shack" employee, whom he had threatened as well as the dwarf. The dwarf then decided that it would be better to learn to use a firearm instead of a knife or sword, as he never wanted to be a ''victim'' again. He shaved off his Afro hairstyle completely, and has worn bald ever since, which, along with history, is responsible for his fighting nickname, 8-Ball, and began self-studying to become a weapons expert, learning practically everything there was to know about modern firearms.

As he liked to put it, "I learned how to use anything ranged, from rocks to rockets."

Subsequently, when not near the "crypt" or in [[Seattle]], he was involved in various mercenary missions around the globe, among other things.

During the battle for the "Crypt" in October 2063 against the [[mercenaries]], who had been hired by the sociopathic [[Aztechnology]] employees [[Thomas Mathers]] and [[Marc Herrara]] to ''cleanse'' the area of its inhabitants, the dwarven weapons expert was largely responsible for the defensive strategy of the defenders and for their armament.
