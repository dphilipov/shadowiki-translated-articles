'''6-Tees''' is a fashion label of [[Horizon Group]].

==Products==
6-Tees' product range focuses on casual, street and casual wear. Retro American casual shirts and T-shirts are available for as little as 20 [[Nuyen]], while a complete urban outfit consisting of a hoodie, jumpsuit, jacket, and T-shirt or dress, along with matching accessories for him and her, costs 150 Nuyen.

In addition, 6-Tees also offers club fashion that caters to the style needs of more specialized subcultures. Spurred on by the success of HoloWear - namely [[Zoé]]s ''[[Second Skin]]'' collection and [[Vashon Island]]s rival product ''Teg-mentum'' - 6-Tees has launched its own, more affordable HoloWear line of jackets and hoodies that project overlapping holograms. Specifically, the '''Strict-9 Jackets''' for 2,200 and '''H-Jumpsuits''' for 2,500 nuyen have been big sellers.

Also, so-called ''guerrilla chic''-promoted by images of war coverage from the [[Amazonian-Aztlanian War|Amazonian-Aztlanian War]] in and around [[Bogotá]] - has proven to be a continued sales success for 6-Tees, even though their direct competitor [[Tribale]], of all people, has made even more profit with the post-apocalyptic look segment.
{{Shadowtalk|They even have a collection of pseudo-[[military gear]] - deliberately thrown together with matching symbols and accessories - designed by ''real freedom fighters'' - if Horizon's advertising machine [[Charisma Associates|Charisma]]'s campaign is to be believed.... and from the proceeds of each sold garment between 0,5 and 5 Nuyen go allegedly into the ''financing of the freedom fight''. - Inconceivable that consumers actually fall for such a clumsy marketing ploy.... and this from a [[corporation]] that is one of the largest prison operators in [[North America]], and has made the concept of ''mental reprogramming'' aka brainwashing the standard in the rehabilitation of offenders.... - I could really puke...!|'''''[[Repeal]]'''''}}
{{shadowtalk|Not to mention athletic and casual shoes. - Their Iguana boots are all the rage again among [[corporate kids]]s right now, with the question of whether to wear the ones from 6-Tees or the ones from [[Beaux Retail Consortium]] almost a matter of faith for many kids... even though the actual, visual differences are maginal at best, and they don't differ measurably in quality!|'''''Shoemaker'''''}}
