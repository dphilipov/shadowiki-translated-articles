The '''11811''' is another of the themed clubs within the [[Berlin]]s [[Metropolis Arcology]].

==Description==
In addition to ''[[Josaphat]]'', a worker named ''11811'' plays a prominent role in the {{WP|Metropolis_(film)|Film Metropolis}} - but its name is given a more modern interpretation in the case of this club: instead of oil-smeared gears, state-of-the-art lighting and holo-installations dominate the world of this hangout, which is said to enjoy high popularity among [[corporate]] sysops and [[hacker]] wannabes. The classic stylistic elements of the Metropolis world are found here in the [[AR]] and in the holograms and monitors, where incessantly programmed personas swing heavy hammers and a clockwork of glowing gears stretches across the club's sky. The whole thing has something of a claustrophobic feel, according to some, helped by the multitude of hidden messages in the AR, which can be inscribed by visitors as a gigantic "walk-in guest book."
