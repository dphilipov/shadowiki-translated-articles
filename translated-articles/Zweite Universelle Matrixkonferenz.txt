{{Shadowtalk|With Villiers pulling the European [[Wireless Matrix Initiative]], making NeoNET one of THE heavyweights in building the wireless [[WiFi matrix]] worldwide... the second is [[Saeder-Krupp]], whose top matrix researcher [[Antonio Vieri]] was present at the meeting, along with [[Lofwyr]]'s chain dog [[Scale]], for a reason!|'''''[[Corpshark]]''''' - <small>A collection of creds, unrestrained power and cold intellect, with a complete abandonment of (meta)human emotion, morality and decency, the likes of which are rarely seen together in one place even today!</small>}}
