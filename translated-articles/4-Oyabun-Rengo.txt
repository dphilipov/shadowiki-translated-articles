The '''4 Oyabun Rengo'''' (English: Four Oyabun Rengo) does not refer to - as the name suggests - an alliance or ring of four ''gumi'' or ''kai'' of [[yakuza]], but rather to the group of four ''oyabuns'' who remain major shareholders of [[Mitsuhama Computer Technologies]]. {{source|1}}

Their old ''gumi'' have long since been effectively either absorbed by the [[corporation]], or the ''Kobun'' and ''Kumi-In'' now form the ''staffs'' of the personal personnel of the four old men, who are now multi-billionaires, and have long since kept completely out of the criminal or semi-legal dealings and bloody feuds of the other yakuza gumi and rengos. - On the other hand, because of their immense wealth, they are far too powerful to be forced by other ''oyabuns'' to join one rengo or the other, or to declare themselves for or against the [[New Way|New Way]]. {{source|1}}

==Contradictory==
Deviantly, however, the term ''''4-Oyabun Rengo''''' is also used to refer to a ''true rengo'', an alliance of four ''gumi'' and ''kai'' respectively, centered in [[Europe]], each under the leadership of its own ''oyabun'', and at least two of which operate in the [[Alliance of German Lands]]: {{source|2}}
