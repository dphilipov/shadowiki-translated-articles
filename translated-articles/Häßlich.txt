'''Ugly''' was an [[adult dragon|adult]] [[Western dragon]] who was employed by the [[United Oil Industries]] corporation in [[Seattle]] as a security officer.

==Biography==
Ugly was appointed security officer for [[United Oil]] in [[Seattle]] on June 24, 2048 {{Ref|1}}

He was ultimately hunted down on {{Shx|June23}} {{Shx|2051}} by a newly minted [[shaman]]n named [[Samuel Verner|Sam - Samuel - Verner]] and a [[street samurai]] named [[Ghost who walks inside]], or Ghost for short, with the dragon falling into Pudget Sound, mortally wounded. Earlier, he had hired the [[Eleven]]ic top runner [[Katherine Hart]] along with her dragon chummer [[Tessien]], tasking her with killing Sam Verner. - When she lied to him - after several failures - claiming to have properly completed the wetwork assignment, Ugly, seeing through the deception, killed the [[Feathered Serpent]], thus also making an enemy of the elf, who subsequently sided with Twist. {{Ref|2}} {{Ref|3}}
{{shadowtalk|You hear some rumors in Seattle, about a series of experiments UniOil is supposed to have done with the corpse of the dragon Ugly.... {{Ref|4}}|'''''Conspir-I-see'''''<br>Maybe they want to bring him back to life... or clone him?|68%}}


==Appearance==
The dragon was brown-green in color, with a lighter belly - similar to that of a crocodile - and reddish-brown, leathery wings. A pair of smaller wing-like outgrowths of the same color sat to the right and left of its elongated head, which was crowned by two backward-facing horns of slightly wavy shape, long and thick, reminiscent of antelope horns. He was also capable of assuming a human form called "'''Jarlath Drake'''', which was possible for him to do shady business through a magic ring. In this human form, he also maintained a close, personal relationship with the [[mage]]in [[Nadia Mirin]] {{Ref|5}}.

==Personality==
Among other things, he was not shy about using [[Shadowrun]]s out of a personal lust for power - and without the knowledge of his superiors at UniOil - against [[AA Corporation|Triple-A Corporation]] [[Renraku]] and to issue numerous murder orders. Subordinates who failed to perform important duties were said to have been eaten by him on occasion.
