The '''Eighty-Eights'''' (short: '''88s''') are a - rather smaller - [[triad]] in [[Seattle]].

==Leadership==
The triad is led by lodge master [[Rick Wu]], a [[UCAS|American]] [[China|Chinese]] descent, who runs his organization as a modern [[crime syndicate|syndicate]], has discarded much of the time-honored tradition of the Triads, and acts more like a [[corporate]][[exec]] himself. - Fittingly, his master of ceremonies [[Ruibai Dong]] is also not a [[wujen]] or [[mage adept]], but a [[hacker|tip hacker]] - or more likely, [[technomancer]].

==Members==
The rejection of [[cyberware]] - common in other triads due to the heavy focus on [[magically gifted]]s and [[ki adept]]s - has now been abandoned by many members of the "Eighty-Eights" as a result of their leaders' modern approach. Rather, [[Vercyberung]] is common among them, and costly implants now represent a status symbol among the triad soldiers of the "88s." - The weakness that the Triad's lack of its own [[mages]] represents is partially offset by loaned forces from the ranks of [[Asia|Asia]] [[Gangs]] who are subordinate to the Eighty-Eights.

Although the Eighty-Eights are the least traditional of the Seattle triads, there are many in their very ranks who are also members of the [[Sai Fan]], an inter-syndicate triad society that accepts only Han Chinese.

==Mode Operandi==
The Eighty-Eights, apart from contacts through the Sai Fan, have cut virtually all ties with the ''parent organizations'' in the old country, and Rick Wu even argues that the Seattle triads must effectively resist triad syndicates in [[Hong Kong]] and the [[Chinese Successor States|Chinese Successor States]] trying to dominate them. This has already led to conflicts with Seattle's two other notable triads - the "[[Octagon]]" and the "[[Yellow Lotus]]" - led to this.

==Business==
The main source of income for the "Eighty-Eights" is illegal gambling, running operations on a large scale as well as small, well-hidden, private mahjong parlors for invited guests only, as well as prostitution and tributes from their vassal gangs, who must pay a portion of their profits to the Triad.
{{Shadowtalk|Oh - the "88s" are quite into [[drugs]] and [[BTL chips|chip trading]] as well.... and make - as I have to admit to my chagrin - really fat creds! ...our luck, that they are far less competent when it comes to securing their warehouses!|'''''[[Cole]]''''' - with "C", like "[[Cutters]]"}}
Their operations are usually well disguised in this regard, allowing them to operate in their own turf - sometimes unnoticed by their competitors - and, for example, in [[Bellevue]] Mahjong]] games for solvent gamblers without coming to the attention of the [[Finnigan]]s, who run an illegal casino in the immediate vicinity. In addition, their activities are concentrated primarily in [[Everett]], where they maintain many dens of vice for off-duty marines and sailors.
 
In [[Auburn]], like the "[[Yellow Lotus|Yellow Lotus]]" and also not with more success, they try to compete with the [[Yak]]s with cheap deals for the resident working-class population.

==Enemies==
Besides the conflicts with the two other Seattle triads as well as the - sometimes violent and brutal - competition with [[Mafia]] and [[Yakuza]], the "Eighty-Eights" have been united since the 2050s by a bitter, hateful enmity characterized by mutual raids with the Seattle "[[Cutters]]", who - at the height of their power - were quite equal to the triad.

==Allies==
The "Eighty-Eights" rely heavily on the street gangs and [[Go-Gangs]], which are allied with them or subordinated to them, and can thus - despite their relatively small number of own members - muster a surprisingly large number of fighters in case of doubt. Specifically, the "[[Tigers]]," Seattle's largest and most powerful Asian gang, serve them as street fighters, storm troopers, and enforcers. Control of the [[gangers]] - namely the "Tigers" - is based on a fanatical, almost sect-like religious devotion to their triad masters....
