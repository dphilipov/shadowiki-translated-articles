The '''9th Berlin District Election''' was held as usual on {{Shx|1._October|1}} {{Shx|2080}} took place.  Elected were the representatives of the districts of the election period II: [[Falkensee]], [[Köpenick]], [[Berlin-Mitte|Mitte]], [[Pankow]], [[Prenzlauer Berg]], [[Spandau]] and [[Tempelhof]]. - The election saw no change at the top of any of the districts, and [[Morek Pflügler]] was also re-elected as second mayor.

==Election statistics==

===Köpenick===
The re-election of ''moderate [[communism|communist]]'' [[Lena Rabeja]] as district representative [[Köpenick]] was never in danger, especially since the only anti-communist opponent [[Clemes Streußner]] [[Clemes Streußner]] (who wanted to try again after 2074) had been doused with gasoline and set on fire by unknown persons in the open street the week before the election.

===Falkensee===
[[Aslan Özdemir]], the "kebab lion" who had been able to consolidate his position in the district during his years as a district representative (and Falkensee's largest, legal employer), was also clearly re-elected. [[USPD]] candidate [[Friedericke Kuhnert]] could at most achieve a respectable success with just 12% of the vote. Another astonishing 4% could be achieved by the registered [[MMVV infected|infected]] and [[magically gifted|magically active]] "[[Judas Moloch]]", who ran for the [[Party of the New Order]] (PNO).

===Spandau===
In [[Spandau]], [[Jurek Kowalczyk|Fletcher]], the [[Troll]] from the autonomous island fortress [[Eiswerder]], has been able to expand his position of power in the three years since his appointment, and his re-election was therefore not really in danger. After all, the established [[ADL]] party [[CVP]] fielded its own candidate, Dr. [[Katrin Lara Wegener]], as an ''"Alternative for Spandau"'', who immediately won 22.6% of the vote.
