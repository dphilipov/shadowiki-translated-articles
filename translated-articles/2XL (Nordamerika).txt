'''2XL'''' is the [[persona]] and [[street name]] of a [[North American]]-born [[troll]]s {{Ref|5}} and [[smuggler]]s who travels around the globe. {{Ref|1}}

==Biography==
By his own account, 2XL once ate a live karkalake as a child because of a dare, scaring the hell out of his mother. However, the doctors she sent him to at the time certified that he had an "immune system like a [[devil rat]]" so this silly dare did him no harm. {{Ref|2}} He spent at least part of his childhood in [[Seattle]], where he witnessed [[Don]] [[O'Malley]] throw a big street party for the residents to keep people busy and safe while he destroyed their entire street block by arson. {{Ref|3}}

As an adult, 2XL - before becoming a ''freelance'' [[Shadowrunner]] - may have been a [[Mafia|Mafioso]] himself, or at least a candidate for inclusion in the ''family'', with certain differences in [[Atlantic City]] apparently leading to the rift between him and the [[Crime Syndicate|Syndicate]]. {{Ref|3}} He later embarked on the career of a self-employed smuggler, transporting illegal cargoes around the globe. In this capacity, he has been almost everywhere, though street-level business seems to be his métier. Accordingly, a true expert in street knowledge, he has countless contacts and knows his way around the [[shadows]] of the entire world. {{Ref|1}} Therefore, in August {{Shx|2071|'71}}, he was only too happy to take up the suggestion of the notorious [[pirate]]en "[[Kane]]" to set up his own [[Tempo]] smuggling operation from the American West Coast to [[Neo-Tokyo]], taking on board insects for the [[Japanese]] [[Mushi-Sushi]] restaurant as official cargo and cover for the [[BAD]] shipment. {{Ref|2}}

==Relationships==
The ''differences'' that ended 2XL's career within the Mafia had to do - as he noted in a [[Shadowtalk]] comment - with a girl in [[Atlantic City]]. Regardless of this, and despite some unpaid bills, he still has good [[connections]] and some insider knowledge in mafia circles, which - despite the obligations of ''[[Omertà]]''' - in the [[Jackpoint]] with the other users. {{Ref|3}}

Kane sometimes addressed him as ''Yankee'' in chat, which was a clear reference to 2XL's origins in the [[UCAS]], while in return he called the ''most notorious man in [[CAS]]'' ''Johnny Rebel'', without either of them taking it as an insult. {{Ref|3}}

At the same time, however, he is also part of [[Jane Foster]]s circle of acquaintances - through their contacts in the smuggling scene.
{{Shadowtalk|...where the good Frosty probably trusts him enough to call him in case of doubt, so that he can take over the role of cavalry for her with his [[T-Bird]], and whip her and her companions out when they are stranded on a ''not-so-official trip'' somewhere in the vastness of the [[North American]] continent, or in really serious trouble...|'''''[[The Laughing Man]]''''' - Hah! Fragging Hah!}}
{{Shadowtalk|Well, she's always made some questionable choices when it comes to her friends... but my little Jane must know that herself by now - she's a big girl, after all!|'''''[[Wordsmyth]]'''''}}

The acronym 2XL is a play on words, as it is pronounced "To Excel" in English, meaning "to excel" or "to surpass someone".

===Danger of confusion:===
There is apparently a second troll and smuggler with close mafia ties, though he cannot be identical to the North American and longtime [[Jackpointer]], since - unlike the latter - he grew up in [[Italy]], and worked for the mafia there. - For more on this, see [[2XL (Italy)|here]].

==Jackpoint contributions==
For the [[shadow file]] "[[Vice]]", he contributed the paragraphs ''"''What it means to be in the Mafia''''' and ''"''Do I look Sicilian, Mon?'''''''' in the Mafia chapter, and wrote about the business ventures of Mafia crown princes and princesses under the title ''"''The Children's Hour'''''''. {{Ref|3}} For the "[[10 Gangs]]" file, he also wrote the chapter on the bizarre [[biker gang]] "'''''[[Blindfish]]'''''" active in northern [[CalFree]] and all along the [[North American]] west coast. {{Ref|4}}

===Shadowtalk===
He also frequently contributed illuminating and useful [[Shadowtalk]] comments to nearly every shadow file posted online by [[FastJack]] at [[Jackpoint]] to date.
