"'''Snowflake'''' is a - presumably [[Great Dragon|Great]] - [[Dragon]], and the only dragon to have appeared in [[Switzerland]].

In [[Geneva]]/[[CSF]] one is extraordinarily proud of the fact that the snow-white majestic draco form of unknown gender rested peacefully on the roof of the [[UNO]] building for 5 minutes during its first - and until long the only - public appearance. All eyewitnesses unanimously described another unusual feature, as this dragon was said to possess feathered wings, something that has not been observed in [[Western Dragon|Western Dragon]] in any other case.

Rumors speak of a [[dragon hoard|hoard]] in the [[Alpine Interdict Zone]] and financial investments at home and abroad, but more details are not known....
