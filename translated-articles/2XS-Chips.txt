'''2XS''' (pronounced ''Twoexess'') is a [[BTL]] variant.

==Profile==

===Effect==
In addition to the pleasure center, as with normal [[BTL]], the nerve pathways responsible for body chemistry are also directly stimulated, immediately causing the release of hormones and endorphins. Not only was this addictive much faster than ordinary BTLs, so that a single trip was usually enough to become addicted, but it could also kill the user very quickly....

==Origin==
This far more dangerous form of BTL chips was originally developed by [[Yamatetsu]], and hit the streets of [[Seattle]] in 2052. Secretly, the string-pullers behind the [[Universal Brotherhood|Universal Brotherhood]] used the proliferation of the addictive chips to find suitable host bodies that could serve as [[spirit vessel|vessels]] of new [[insect spirits]]: Whoever - according to their perverse logic - could survive a 2XS addiction was also strong enough to host an insect spirit, and bring about a successful fusion....

Rumor has it that the [[corporation]] but also its [[China|Chinese]] competitor [[Tan Tien, Inc.]] experimented with burn-out chips based on 2XS technology in 2058 in the West African [[Pirate]] and [[Ivory Coast]], giving the user the one-time, short-term benefits of a [[reflex booster]] when they inserted such a chip into the [[chip socket]].

Evidence of the illegal field tests, however, could never be produced....
