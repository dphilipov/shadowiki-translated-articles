The '''29th Amendment to the Constitution''' of the [[USA|United States of America]] (''29th Amendment to the Constitution''), removes the two-term limit placed on presidential terms by the {{WP|22nd_Amendment_to_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States|22nd_Amendment}}. Introduced during the second term of U.S. President [[William Jarman]] on {{Shx|December|7}} {{Shx|2020}}. Jarman is the only president of the United States besides {{WP|Franklin_D._Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt}} the only President of the United States to govern for more than two terms.

In the [[UCAS]], which succeeded the United States in law, there is also no presidential term limit. To date, however, no UCAS president has been re-elected more than twice, although President [[Kyle Haeffner|Haeffner]] came close.
