'''24 Hours of Power''' is an action series set in a dystopian [[Seattle]] in the near future, where the [[Crash 2.0]] left much greater devastation than it did in reality.


==Plot==
In the world of the series, the city is in the claws of the evil corporation "[[Vergas Inc.]]", which controls large parts of [[Latin America]]. It is about a "good [[CIA]] agent", ''Jason Nobody'' (played by [[Jack Bauer]]), who is in Seattle with super-soldiers and the mystrious [[Tinga]] ([[Jane Buffalo]]) comes into contact. From her, he learns that she and others escaped as children from a secret cloning program run by Vergas Inc. and are now trying to make their way in civic life and rescue those left behind at the time.

==Reception==
[[Aztechnology]] complained against the strikingly depicted parallels to ''"Vergas Inc."'', which is why they were subsequently toned down.

Conspiracy theorists in the Matrix claim that the show's creators have information about [[Aztechnology]]'s ''[[Manticore]].program'', which they incorporated into the show, and that the show's writer, [[Alec McDowell]], is said to have inside information about it.

{{Shadowtalk|Aztechnology had tried to file a lawsuit against the series, so they had some trouble with the broadcast, which was delayed. This explains the difference between production year and year of broadcast. However, [[Horizon]], as the main financier of the series, was convinced of the series, so they shot some seasons in order to have material. In the [[Shadow]] there were some disputes because of the series, between the two corporations. Especially now in times of the [[Amazon-Aztlan War|War]] in the south between [[Amazonia]] and [[Aztlan]], there seem to be rumors that they want to shoot a new season and pick up the current events.|'''''Snoop Dogg'''''|50%}}





==Sources==
This series is an invention of user "[[User:Japan001|Japan001]]", and does not appear in any official Shadowrun source. It is very much inspired by the real-life television series "{{WP|Dark_Angel_(television series)|Dark Angel}}".
