The '''N'drangheta''' or '''Calabrian [[Mafia]]'''' is one of the [[crime syndicates]] represented in the ''Alta Commissione''.

Its members are referred to as ''''''ndranghettisti'''''.

==History==
The '''N'drangheta''' and in the last decade of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century was perhaps the most powerful, but in any case the most aggressive and most profitable of the mafia syndicates [[Italy]]s.

For more on its history - if known outside the ''family'' - see the history page {{WP|'Ndrangheta|Wikipedia}}.

In the {{Shx|2020s|2020s}}, its power base in northern Italy was weakened by a massive - already paramilitary - strike by the Italian [[police]], as it provoked Italian state power with its traditional focus on brutal crimes such as bank robbery, kidnapping, kidnapping, extortion of protection money - the ''pizzo'' - and contract killings.

In the {{Shx|2030s|2030s}}, in the wake of [[GeMiTo]]'s collapse - and even after the creation of the ''Alta Commissione'' in {{Shx|2046}} by the Sicilians around ''Don'' [[Lucio Feretti]] the reigning ''Capo di tutti Capi'' [[Sicily]]s - it was repeatedly involved in bloody gang wars with the smaller, [[Naples|Naples]] [[Camorra]] split, [[Sacra Corona Union]], which even required the intervention of the [[Fratellanza]]. Moreover, the ''pious'' ''Capi'' of the N'drangheta opposed the inclusion of the [[Grey Wolf Maffiya|Grey Wolves]] in the ''Alta Commissione'', and it is deeply at odds with the [[Albania|Albanian]] [[Fares]]. In the lawless [[Sprawl|Megasprawl]] of GeMiTo, bloody confrontations with the Albanians continue to occur in the mid {{Shx|2060s}}.

Originally a small ''N'drise'' - a clan-based mafia - centered in Calabria and without central leadership, the N'drangheta in the 2060s is matriarchally ruled by ''Donna'' [[Allegra Fusilli]] as if by a queen, which may be one reason why the Sacra Corona Union - whose ''Cupola'' consists of old-school macho hardliners - is hostile to it.  
{{Shadowtalk|Not "as of a queen" - ''Donna'' Allegra '''is''' a queen, a wasp queen in flesh form, to be exact, since the [[Insect Spirits|Bugs]] have actually managed to infiltrate the N'drangheta as much as the [[Moonies]] or the [[Universal Brotherhood|UB]]!|'''''[[Grey Knight]]'''''}}
{{Shadowtalk|It's a bit different, though: the ''N'drise'' came quite a bit closer to extinction in the last, great war with the Sacra Corona than is generally known, and the ''Donna'' pledged her soul to the Wasp Queen to save the organization from annihilation. ...it was practically the grasp for the last straw, and that now nearly a quarter of our ''Soldati'' carry wasp spirits inside themselves and ''Donna'' form Allegras "nest" inside the ''N'drise'' was now the price of the survival of the ''Families''... even if the other syndicates of the ''Alta Commissione'' would wipe us out even more if they had hard evidence! - But there the well known [[magic shyness]] of the [[Cosa Nostra]] works for us...|'''''Vespero'''''}}
{{Shx|2070}} - almost 6 years after the [[Crash of 2064|second Matrixcrash]] - however, just as in the late 20th century, the N'drangheta is still active [[Europe]]wide and extremely powerful. Thus, it is not surprising that N'drangheta thugs provide welcome support to the [[Gasperi]]s in the [[Rhine-Ruhr Megaplex]] in the endless disputes of their ''don'' [[Lupo Gasperi]] with the reformed [[Vory v Zakone|Ruhr Area Vory]].
{{Shadowtalk|Whereby I am not sure if ''Don'' Lupo knows what he has brought into his house, respectively into his front yard.... it's more than 10 years now, but they haven't forgotten the "[[Aktion Zebra]]" in the Ruhrplex with its partly very expensive consequences for the ''family'' yet! |'''''[[Jacko]]'''''}}
In 2071, the year of the [[Tempo]] boom, the N'drangheta in GeMiTo was a direct negotiating partner and major buyer for the [[BAD]]s of the [[Olaya Cartel]]s, which - just like the [[Milieu Marseillais|Marseilles Milieu]] - behind the back of the ''Alta Commissione'', tried to make big money selling Tempo, and to use the profits to improve its position among the European mafias. - Unfortunately for her, the Camorra, which controlled the docks of [[Genoa]], found her out and was not happy about the additional source of income of the competing organization in her immediate neighborhood. When [[Luis Cordero]] then betrayed his partner [[Filipe Munoz|Munoz]], and negotiated directly with the Sicilians, ''Donna'' Allegra therefore also instantly swung around, and willingly provided her men for the Fratallanzza team that was to liquidate the Olaya delegation in [[Lisbon]], and thus send a clear message to the [[Latin Americans]]. - Whether this ''belated proof of obedience'' was enough, however, to save them and their syndicate from reprisals by the other organizations represented in the Alta Commissione, and angered by the events during the Tempo crisis, remains to be seen....

In [[Australia]], an offshoot of the N'drangheta, the [[Gatto N'drise]], has established itself in [[Sidney]], where it belongs to the ''[[Melbourne]] Commissione''', and makes its [[nuyen]] by acting as ''blockade runners'' on a large scale, smuggling illegal [[cargo]] of all kinds into the [[free city]] encircled by the [[Mana Tower]]. While their own ''Capo di Famiglia'', ''Don'' [[Henry James Gatto]] represents his ''Ndrise in the Melbourne Commissione, he at the same time unquestioningly recognizes ''Dona'' Allegra as the ''Capa di Capi'' who commands over the N'drangheta as a whole.
